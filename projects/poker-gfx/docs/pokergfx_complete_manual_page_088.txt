A
 
LIVE
 
ANTE
 
is
 
a
 
special
 
type
 
of
 
ante
 
that
 
is
 
treated
 
as
 
a
 
live
 
bet.
 
This
 
is
 
essentially
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
every
 
player
 
posting
 
a
 
blind
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
amount
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
blinds
 
that
 
are
 
payable.
 
When
 
this
 
type
 
of
 
ante
 
is
 
selected,
 
straddle
 
bets
 
cannot
 
be
 
used.

where
 
there’s

for

When
 
playing
 
TEXAS
 
HOLD’EM,
 
entering
 
a
 
value
 
in
 
the
 
7-DEUCE
 
box
 
will
 
cause
 
that
 
amount
 
to
 
be
 
deducted
 
from
 
every
 
losing
 
player
 
in
 
the
 
hand
 
when
 
a
 
hand
 
is
 
won
 
by
 
a
 
player
 
that
 
has
 
7-2,
 
whether
 
by
 
fold
 
or
 
showdown
 
(the
 
player
 
must
 
scoop
 
the
 
main
 
pot).

For

and
 
DRAW
 
games,
 
when
 
a

is
 
entered
 
in
 
the
 
BOMB
 
POT
 
box,
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
the

is
 
deducted
 
from
 
each
 
players
 
stack
 
at
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
hand
 
as
 
if
 
it
 
were
