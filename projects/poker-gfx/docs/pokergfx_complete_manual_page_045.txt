2011-2025  Auto Delay 
This feature will turn secure delay on as soon as the first hand is detected, then stop 
it
 
after
 
a
 
period
 
of
 
inactivity.
 
To
 
enable,
 
set
 
the
 
'Auto'
 
box
 
to
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
minutes
 
of
 
inactivity
 
(zero
 
disables
 
the
 
feature).
 
This
 
is
 
useful
 
in
 
environments
 
where
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
Server
 
is
 
restricted
 
–
 
the
 
only
 
action
 
required
 
to
 
start
 
the
 
secure
 
delay
 
is
 
to
 
start
 
a
 
game.
 
/g0
 
You
 
should
 
set
 
the
 
inactivity
 
period
 
to
 
a
 
value
 
greater
 
than
 
the
 
longest
 
break
 
in
 
the
 
game,
 
to
 
prevent
 
the
 
stream
 
being
 
stopped
 
before
 
the
 
game
 
has
 
ended.
 
Delay Countdown 
When a secure delay is started, a countdown clock is displayed to viewers that 
indicates
 
when
 
the
 
video
 
will
 
start.
 
To
 
display
 
a
 
custom
 
still
 
image
 
behind
 
the
 
clock,
 
click
 
the
 
‘Countdown
 
Background’
 
box
 
and
 
select
 
a
 
background
 
image.
 
The
 
countdown
 
clock
 
can
 
be
 
disabled
 
by
 
unchecking
 
the
 
‘Countdown’
 
option.
 
/g0
 
Selecting
 
a
 
video
 
file
 
from
 
the
 
‘Countdown
 
Lead-Out
 
Video’
 
dropdown
 
box
 
will
 
cause
 
that
 
video
 
to
 
play
 
automatically
 
when
 
the
 
delay
 
countdown
 
reaches
 
zero.
 
Video
 
files
 
are
 
stored
 
in
 
the
 
Media
 
folder
 
(see
 
the
 
section
 
on
 
Player
 
Photos
 
for
 
more
 
information
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
configure
 
this).
