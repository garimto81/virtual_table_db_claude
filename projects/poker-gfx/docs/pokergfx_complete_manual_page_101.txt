2011-2025  MultiGFX 
The MultiGFX feature allows you to generate multiple video streams simultaneously 
from
 
a
 
single
 
RFID
 
table,
 
each
 
with
 
its
 
own
 
independent
 
graphics,
 
delay
 
and
 
video
 
settings.
 
 
This is achieved by running multiple copies of PokerGFX on separate computers which 
are
 
networked
 
together.
 
Enabling
 
the
 
‘MultiGFX’
 
option
 
forces
 
PokerGFX
 
to
 
use
 
another
 
running
 
copy
 
of
 
PokerGFX
 
as
 
a
 
data
 
source
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
physical
 
RFID
 
table.
 
To get started with a MultiGFX configuration, follow these steps: 
●
 
Connect
 
the
 
RFID
 
table
 
via
 
USB
 
and
 
start
 
PokerGFX
 
normally
 
(this
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX
 
that
 
controls
 
the
 
other
 
secondary
 
PokerGFXs).
  
●
 
Ensure
 
that
 
both
 
a
 
table
 
name
 
and
 
password
 
have
 
been
 
configured
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Start
 
PokerGFX
 
on
 
another
 
computer
 
(the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX)
 
that
 
is
 
networked
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Ensure
 
the
 
table
 
name
 
and
 
password
 
settings
 
in
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX
 
match
 
the
 
settings
 
configured
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Enable
 
the
 
‘MultiGFX’
 
check
 
box
 
(on
 
the
 
secondary
 
server
 
only,
 
not
 
the
 
primary).
 
The
 
table
 
USB
 
icon
 
will
 
indicate
 
a
 
link
 
symbol.
 
The table USB icon should turn green, indicating the link is now active. Any game 
event
 
that
 
occurs
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX
 
will
 
be
 
transmitted
 
to
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX,
 
as
 
if
 
the
 
secondary
 
were
 
directly
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
RFID
 
table
 
itself.
 
You can now modify any settings in the secondary PokerGFX to customize the 
secondary
 
stream
 
as
 
required,
 
including
 
when
 
to
 
show
 
hole
 
cards,
 
graphics
 
‘skin’
 (Pro 
version
 
only), video resolution and stream delay (or none, if you want a live stream).
