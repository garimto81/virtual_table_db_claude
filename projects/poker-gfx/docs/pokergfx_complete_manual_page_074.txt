2011-2025  Strip Editor 
The Strip is graphic element that displays all players across the top of the screen 
along
 
with
 
chip
 
counts
 
and
 
position.
 
It
 
is
 
resized
 
dynamically
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
The Strip editor is the same as the Player, Board and Blinds editor. The composited 
element
 
you
 
produce
 
will
 
be
 
replicated
 
in
 
a
 
horizontal
 
row
 
and
 
scaled
 
if
 
necessary
 
to
 
accommodate
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
