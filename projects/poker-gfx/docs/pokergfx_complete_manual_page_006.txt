2011-2025  Introduction 
PokerGFX is a powerful video titling software suite that generates real time poker 
graphics
 
for
 
video
 
overlay.
 
Used
 
with
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader,
 
it
 
will
 
automatically
 
detect
 
hole
 
and
 
community
 
cards
 
with
 
no
 
human
 
intervention
 
–
 
however
 
it
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
used
 
with
 
a
 
conventional
 
‘hole
 
cam’
 
table
 
by
 
entering
 
card
 
information
 
manually.
 
In RFID mode, a USB cable (or WIFI link for completely wireless operation) connects 
the
 
table
 
to
 
a
 
Windows
 
computer
 
which
 
runs
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
software.
 
The
 
server
 
communicates
 
with
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
track
 
the
 
movement
 
of
 
RFID-enabled
 
playing
 
cards
 
between
 
players,
 
and
 
converts
 
this
 
information
 
to
 
a
 
graphical
 
display
 
which
 
is
 
superimposed
 
on
 
video
 
of
 
the
 
game.
 
Tracking of betting action is possible by having the dealer or another observer enter 
player
 
actions,
 
using
 
a
 
convenient
 
touch
 
screen
 
wireless
 
tablet
 
interface
 
or
 
by
 
using
 
a
 
mouse/keyboard.
 
In
 
this
 
mode,
 
all
 
graphics
 
required
 
for
 
a
 
TV
 
broadcast
 
or
 
livestream
 
are
 
generated
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
Game video and player actions can be recorded for post-production and streamed 
live
 
with
 
an
 
optional
 
delay.
 
All technology is completely invisible to players, and special RFID-enabled playing 
cards
 
have
 
exactly
 
the
 
same
 
look
 
and
 
feel
 
as
 
high
 
quality
 
acetate
 
style
 
cards.
 
Evaluation Mode 
PokerGFX requires a USB security dongle for normal use. The dongle can be plugged 
into
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
or
 
an
 
available
 
USB
 
on
 
your
 
PC,
 
&
 
is
 
automatically
 
detected
 
when
 
PokerGFX
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
an
 
RFID
 
table.
 
When
 
purchased
 
without
 
an
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
for
 
use
 
with
 
a
 
hole
 
cam
 
table
 
or
 
in
 
MultiGFX
 
Secondary
 
mode,
 
the
 
dongle
 
is
 
shipped
 
as
 
a
 
separate
 
item,
 
and
 
must
 
be
 
plugged
 
into
 
the
 
PC
 
running
 
PokerGFX
 
at
 
all
 
times.
 
If no dongle is detected, PokerGFX runs in evaluation mode. In this mode, no features 
are
 
restricted
 
however
 
the
 
software
 
will
 
shut
 
down
 
after
 
10
 
minutes.
