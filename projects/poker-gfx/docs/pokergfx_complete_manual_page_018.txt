For
 
security,
 
WIFI
 
settings
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
modified

the

To
 
protect
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
game,
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
uses
 
strong
 
encryption
 
when
 
communicating
 
with
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
in
 
both
 
USB
 
and
 
WIFI
 
modes.
  
/g0
 
When
 
operating
 
in
 
WIFI-only
 
mode,
 
remove
 
the
 
USB
 
security
 
key
 
from
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
and
 
plug
 
it
 
directly
 
into
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
PC.
 
This
 
will
 
prevent
 
PokerGFX
 
from
 
dropping
 
into
 
evaluation
 
mode.
 
Don’t
 
lose
 
the
 
key!
 
It
 
contains
 
your
 
software
 
license
 
and
 
cannot
 
be
 
replaced.
