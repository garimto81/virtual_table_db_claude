2011-2025  Action Tracker 
By default, when used with the RFID table, the PokerGFX Server operates in Auto 
display
 
mode.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
all
 
active
 
players
 
are
 
displayed
 
from
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
a
 
hand,
 
and
 
are
 
removed
 
as
 
they
 
fold.
 
Board
 
cards
 
are
 
displayed
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
dealt,
 
along
 
with
 
each
 
player’s
 
pot
 
equity.
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
hand
 
the
 
display
 
is
 
cleared
 
ready
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
hand
 
to
 
begin.
 
All
 
of
 
this
 
happens
 
completely
 
automatically,
 
without
 
any
 
need
 
for
 
human
 
assistance.
 
In Auto mode, the server can’t display any betting or pot information as it has no way 
of
 
following
 
the
 
action.
 
To
 
create
 
the
 
complete
 
TV
 
style
 
viewing
 
experience,
 
it
 
needs
 
help
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
the
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
is
 
also
 
required
 
when
 
using
 
PokerGFX
 
without
 
an
 
RFID
 
table.
 
Action Tracker is a touch screen application that performs different functions 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
person
 
using
 
it:
 
Game Tracker Uses the main console of Action Tracker to enter chip counts and betting information as the game progresses, usually on a wireless touch tablet.  If you’re using PokerGFX in stand-alone mode, without an RFID table, Action Tracker is also used to enter hole and community cards.   Commentator / Director Uses the Statistics console to monitor chip counts and player statistics in real time. The commentator can also use the Statistics console to display chip counts over the live video at any time, and operate the scrolling ticker.

Action
 
Tracker
 
has
 
a
 
User
 
Interface
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
heavily
 
optimized
 
for
 
fast
 
and
 
convenient
 
input
 
using
 
a
 
touch
 
screen
 
device.
 
While
 
it
 
is
 
possible
 
to
 
operate
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
mouse
 
this
 
is
 
NOT
 
recommended
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
far
 
slower.
