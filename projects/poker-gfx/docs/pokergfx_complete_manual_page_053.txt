  Indent Action When this option is enabled, the ‘Action On’ player is indented towards the centre of the screen.   Chipcount Precision  Exact Amount Exact number of chips is displayed. Smart Amount (‘k’ & ‘M’ Large amounts are automatically abbreviated with ‘k’ (x 1,000) and ‘M’ (x 1,000,000). Smart Amount, extra precision Same as Smart Amount, but with up to 3 decimal places for extra precision.    Currency Symbol When this option is enabled, all chip amounts are displayed with the local currency symbol (useful for some cash games).   Trailing Currency Symbol Displays the currency symbol to the right of the amount, instead of to the left. 
  Divide all amounts by 100 Causes all chip amounts to be divided by 100 before display. This permits the use of very small denomination chips (0.25, 0.50 etc). In this mode, enter all chip amounts in Action Tracker in cents (eg. $0.25 would be entered as 25; $10 would be entered as $1000).   Show knockout rank Displays the rank of eliminated players on the chip count display. If Payouts have been entered, payouts for each eliminated player are also displayed.   Show as Eliminated Displays the message ELIMINATED on a player graphic if that players stack is reduced to zero.
