2011-2025  Dynamic Delay 
NOTE: This option is only available with a Pro server license. 
The Dynamic Delay feature automatically skips tourney breaks during a delayed 
stream
 
by
 
starting
 
with
 
a
 
much
 
longer
 
delay
 
which
 
is
 
progressively
 
reduced
 
every
 
time
 
there's
 
a
 
break.
 
To use this feature, enable the 'Dynamic Delay' checkbox in Output Settings and enter 
the
 
starting
 
delay
 
in
 
minutes.
 
The
 
starting
 
delay
 
is
 
the
 
total
 
length
 
of
 
all
 
breaks
 
expected
 
to
 
occur
 
during
 
the
 
stream
 
PLUS
 
the
 
normal
 
security
 
delay
 
you
 
use.
 
When this mode is active, the 'Secure Delay' value which normally determines the 
fixed
 
security
 
delay
 
(typically
 
15
 
-
 
30
 
minutes)
 
becomes
 
the
 
MINIMUM
 
delay.
 
Every
 
time
 
there's
 
a
 
break
 
between
 
hands
 
of
 
greater
 
than
 
10
 
minutes,
 
the
 
delay
 
is
 
reduced
 
until
 
the
 
minimum
 
delay
 
value
 
is
 
reached.

Example:
 
You're
 
streaming
 
a
 
tourney
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
15
 
minute
 
break
 
every
 
2
 
hour
 
level.
 
The
 
stream
 
will
 
last
 
5
 
hours,
 
and
 
your
 
'Secure
 
Delay'
 
setting
 
is
 
30
 
minutes.
 
The
 
'Dynamic
 
Delay'
 
value
 
should
 
be
 
(2
 
breaks
 
X
 
15
 
minutes)
 
+
 
30
 
minutes
 
=
 
60
 
minutes.
 
Your
 
delay
 
will
 
start
 
at
 
60
 
minutes
 
and
 
gradually
 
reduce
 
to
 
30
 
minutes
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
session.
  
/g0
 
Dynamic
 
Delay
 
is
 
disabled
 
when
 
Chroma
 
Key
 
is
 
enabled,
 
as
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
impossible
 
to
 
sync
 
externally
 
delayed
 
video
 
to
 
a
 
changing
 
delay.
