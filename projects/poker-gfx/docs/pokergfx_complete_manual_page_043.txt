2011-2025  Vertical Video (9x16) 
Vertical video is a mobile phone friendly format supported by YouTube and some 
other
 
streaming
 
platforms.
 
It’s
 
popular
 
with
 
content
 
creators
 
shooting

(Point
 
of
 
View)

When
 
vertical
 
video
 
is
 
enabled,
 
all
 
camera

on
 
their
 
side.
 
This
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
use

regular
 
NDI
 
camera
 
app
 
on
 
your
 
phone
 
held
