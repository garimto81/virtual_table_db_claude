The appearance and behaviour of the PIP can be modified in the Editor: 
Max Time This setting limits the amount of time the PIP is active when there are long gaps between hands. Setting this value to zero will cause the PIP to show at all times in between hands. A value of 5 will hide the PIP after 5 seconds.   Border A border of any colour and thickness can be drawn around the PIP area by selecting a non-zero ‘size’ value.   Opacity Use the slider bar to set the opacity of the PIP. Lower values make the PIP more ‘see through’.   Auto Centre When enabled, this setting forces the PIP output area to be automatically centred in the video window at all times.   Refresh Refreshes both the local video and remote computer images.
