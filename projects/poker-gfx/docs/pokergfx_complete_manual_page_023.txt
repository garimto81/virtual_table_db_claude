Checking
 
the
 
‘Ignore
 
Tags’
 
box
 
will
 
cause
 
the
 
Server
 
to
 
operate
 
in
 
tag-less
 
mode.
 
In
 
this
 
mode,
 
player
 
ID
 
cards
 
are
 
ignored
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
possible
 
to
 
manually
 
enter
 
player
 
names
 
using
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
In order for the Server to display the correct player names on the graphic overlay, 
each
 
player
 
must
 
identify
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
sitting
 
at
 
the
 
table.
 
This
 
is
 
done
 
by
 
issuing
 
an
 
identity
 
card
 
to
 
each
 
player.
 
To
 
make
 
a
 
new
 
player
 
identity
 
card:
 
●
 
Ensure
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
cards
 
on
 
either
 
of
 
the
 
Muck
 
positions;
  
●
 
Locate
 
the
 
input
 
text
 
box
 
in
 
the
 
Server
 
window
 
underneath
 
the
 
‘Tag
 
Player’
 
button,
 
and
 
enter
 
the
 
new
 
player’s
 
name;
  
●
 
Click
 
the
 
‘Tag
 
Player’
 
button;
  
●
 
Place
 
a
 
blank
 
identity
 
card
 
on
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
Muck
 
positions
 
on
 
the
 
playing
 
surface;
  
●
 
A
 
beep
 
will
 
sound
 
and
 
the
 
text
 
box
 
will
 
clear.
 
The
 
card
 
has
 
been
 
registered
 
with
 
the
 
player’s
 
name.

When
 
a

her
 
identity
 
card
 
on
 
the

A few rules must be observed to enable the Server to track the action correctly:

antenna
 
area

be
 
fanned
 
out
 
or
 
placed
 
side
 
by
 
side
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
 
for
 
best
 
reading
 
performance.
