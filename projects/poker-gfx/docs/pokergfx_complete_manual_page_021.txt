Register Playing Cards 
Each card in a new deck must be initialized before it can be used. To initialize a new 
deck
 
of
 
cards:
 
●
 
Ensure
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
playing
 
cards
 
on
 
the
 
playing
 
surface.
  
●
 
Locate
 
the
 
‘Register
 
Deck’
 
button
 
and
 
click
 
it.
  
●
 
Follow
 
the
 
on-screen
 
instructions
 
by
 
placing
 
each
 
card
 
in
 
the
 
deck
 
on
 
a
 
muck
 
antenna,
 
one
 
at
 
a
 
time.
  
●
 
The
 
process
 
is
 
complete
 
when
 
all
 
52
 
cards
 
have
 
been
 
scanned.

This
 
procedure
 
only

Once
 
complete,
 
the

never
 
need
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
the

again,
 
unless
 
re-installing
