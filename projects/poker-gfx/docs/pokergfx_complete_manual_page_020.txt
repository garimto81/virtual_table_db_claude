antennas.
  
●
 
Follow
 
the
 
instructions
 
on
 
screen,
 
and
 
move
 
the
 
card
 
(any
 
playing
 
card)
 
to
 
each
 
antenna
 
as
 
requested.
  
●
 
Press
 
the
 
‘Skip’
 
button
 
to
 
move
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
antenna
 
group
 
to
 
suit
 
the
 
table
 
configuration.
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
software
 
supports
 
up
 
to
 
10
 
players,
 
but
 
your
 
table
 
has
 
only
 
been
 
built
 
for
 
8
 
players.
 
When
 
the
 
software
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
the
 
card
 
to
 
player
 
#9
 
(which
 
you
 
can’t
 
do
 
since
 
there
 
are
 
only
 
8),
 
press
 
the
 
‘Skip’
 
button.
 
Players
 
9
 
and
 
10
 
will
 
be
 
skipped,
 
and
 
the
 
sequence
 
will
 
move
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
muck
 
antennas.
 
Similarly,
 
if
 
only
 
1
 
muck
 
antenna
 
has
 
been
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
table,
 
press
 
the
 
‘Skip’
 
button
 
again
 
when
 
prompted
 
to
 
move
 
the
 
card
 
to
 
muck
 
antenna
 
#2,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
ignored.
  
●
 
Each
 
antenna
 
position
 
can
 
be
 
installed
 
as
 
either
 
standard
 
(1
 
antenna)
 
or
 
double
 
(2
 
antennas
 
acting
 
together
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
double
 
sized
 
reading
 
area).
 
Ensure
 
the
 
‘Double
 
Antenna’
 
checkbox
 
is
 
set
 
accordingly
 
before
 
moving
 
the
 
playing
 
card,
 
as
 
instructed,
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
position.
 
●
 
Tables
 
can
 
be
 
optionally
 
configured
 
with
 
Player
 
UPCARDS
 
antennas.
 
An
 
UPCARDS
 
antenna
 
is
 
an
 
optional
 
second
 
antenna
 
for
 
each
 
player,
 
used
 
to
 
automate
 
the
 
reading
 
of
 
player
 
cards
 
that
 
are
 
dealt
 
face
 
up
 
in
 
a
 
STUD
 
game
 
(if
 
UPCARDS
 
antennas
 
are
 
not
 
installed,
 
face
 
up
 
cards
 
must
 
be
 
entered
 
manually
 
using
 
Action
 
Tracker).
 
If
 
UPCARDS
 
antennas
 
are
 
not
 
installed,
 
click
 
‘Skip’
 
when
 
prompted
 
to
 
move
 
the
 
card
 
to
 
the
 
PLAYER
 
1
 
UPCARDS
 
ANTENNA
 
to
 
finish
 
the
 
calibration
 
procedure.
