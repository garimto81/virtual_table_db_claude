By
 
default,
 
the
 
colour
 
of
 
the
 
text
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
graphic
 
element
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
appears.
 
It’s
 
possible
 
to
 
override
 
the
 
colour
 
of
 
individual
 
text
 
items
 
by
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘ForeCol’
 
and
 
‘BackCol’
 
columns.
 
These
 
colours
 
are
 
used

to
 
the

setting.

In
 
the
 
default
 
skin,
 
this
 
feature
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
colour
 
of
 
the
 
‘All
 
In’
 
action
 
text
 
(and
 
others),
 
so
 
it’s
 
displayed
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
colour
 
to
 
other
 
actions.
  
●
 
Click
 
a
 
foreground
 
or

Click
 
in
 
the
 
‘BkImage’
 
column
 
to
 
add
 
a
 
background
 
image
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
displayed
 
behind
 
the
 
text.
 
Images
 
are
 
resized
 
to
 
fit
 
the
 
text
 
bounding
 
box
 
and
 
only
 
display
 
when
 
the
 
text
 
is
 
visible.
 
An
 
image
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
Language
 
editor
 
will
 
override
 
an
 
image
 
defined
 
as
 
a
 
text
 
background
 
anywhere
 
else
 
in
 
the
 
skin.

RIGHT-clicking
 
on
 
the
 
‘BkImage’
 
column
 
enables
 
the
 
display
 
of
 
a
 
background
 
image
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
added
 
to
 
a
 
text
 
field
 
in
 
an
 
element
 
(for
 
example,
 
the
 
ACTION
 
field
 
of
 
the
 
PLAYER
 
element)
 
and
 
configured
 
as
 
‘Triggered
 
by
 
Language
 
Text’.

Some
 
text
 
items
 
contain
 
a
 
‘#’
 
symbol.
 
This
 
symbol
 
is
 
automatically
 
replaced
 
with
 
the
 
amount
 
that
 
relates
 
to
 
the
 
text.
 
For
 
example,
 
“All
 
In
 
#”
 
would
 
appear
 
as
 
“All
 
In
 
1,000”
 
(or
 
whatever
 
the
 
all
 
in
 
amount
 
is).
 
If
 
you
 
don’t
 
wish
 
the
 
amount
 
to
 
appear,
 
simply
 
omit
 
the
 
‘#’
 
symbol
 
from
 
the
 
text.
