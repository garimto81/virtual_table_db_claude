2011-2025  Check Deck 
A previously registered deck can be quickly checked to determine whether any cards 
are
 
‘dead’
 
(stopped
 
responding
 
due
 
to
 
damage
 
or
 
wear).
 
To check a deck, open Action Tracker, touch/click the CHECK button at the top of the 
console.
 
A
 
full
 
deck
 
of
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
displayed.
 
One
 
by
 
one,
 
scan
 
each
 
card
 
in
 
the
 
deck
 
on
 
the
 
community
 
card
 
antenna.
 
As
 
cards
 
are
 
scanned
 
they
 
are
 
dimmed,
 
so
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
deck
 
any
 
cards
 
that
 
are
 
still
 
highlighted
 
are
 
dead
 
and
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
replaced.
