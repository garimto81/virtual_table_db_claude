2011-2025  Fonts 
Any TrueType font may be used. To use a font, install it on the computer that the skin 
is
 
being
 
created
 
on,
 
then
 
select
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
font
 
selection
 
window.
 
Once a font is selected and saved in a skin, that font does not need to be installed on 
any
 
other
 
computer
 
that
 
the
 
skin
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
on.

Chroma Keying semi-transparent skins 
Some video mixers do not handle semi-transparent graphics well when chroma 
keying,
 
and
 
semi-transparent
 
images
 
often
 
become
 
partially
 
invisible.
 
When the ‘Remove Partial Transparency When Chroma Key Enabled’ checkbox is 
enabled,
 
all
 
semi-transparent
 
portions
 
of
 
images
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
are
 
made
 
opaque
 
by
 
adjusting
 
the
 
alpha
 
channel
 
only
 
for
 
those
 
areas.
 
This
 
effect
 
is
 
only
 
applied
 
when
 
the
 
Video
 
Sources
 
->
 
Chroma
 
Key
 
feature
 
is
 
enabled. 
/g0
 
This
 
feature
 
does
 
not
 
completely
 
disable
 
transparency;
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
image
 
which
 
are
 
100%
 
transparent
 
will
 
remain
 
transparent,
 
preserving
 
the
 
look
 
of
 
deliberately
 
see-through
 
areas
 
(for
 
example
 
rounded
 
corners).
 
UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) skins 
Skins developed before support for 4k video resolution was added were designed to 
fit
 
a
 
1920
 
x
 
1080
 
display,
 
and
 
are
 
auto
 
downscaled
 
to
 
fit
 
lower
 
resolutions
 
such
 
as
 
1280
 
x
 
720
 
as
 
required.
 
These
 
older
 
skins
 
are
 
upscaled
 
when
 
3840
 
x
 
2160
 
is
 
selected
 
as
 
the
 
video
 
resolution,
 
but
 
this
 
results
 
in
 
an
 
unavoidable
 
loss
 
of
 
quality.
 
All new skins should be designed to fit a 3840 x 2160 display, which will result in the 
best
 
possible
 
quality
 
at
 
all
 
resolutions.
 
Skins
 
that
 
contain
 
graphic
 
elements
 
sized
 
to
 
fit
 
4k
 
should
 
have
 
the
 
‘Designed
 
for
 
4K
 
(3840
 
x
 
2160)’
 
checkbox
 
enabled.
 
Size Adjustment 
Click and drag the ‘Adjust Size’ trackbar to quickly adjust the size of all the graphic 
elements
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
without
 
modifying
 
the
 
actual
 
images.
