NOTE: This option is only available with a Pro license. 
A skin is a visual theme for the graphic overlay. It is consistent across all of the 
individual
 
graphic
 
elements
 
and
 
gives
 
your
 
production
 
an
 
overall
 
‘look
 
and
 
feel’.
 
Skins
 
contain
 
definitions
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
graphics,
 
the
 
font,
 
and

of
 
each
