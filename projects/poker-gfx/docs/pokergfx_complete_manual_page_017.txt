2011-2025  RFID Reader 
The RFID Reader collects data about the position of RFID enabled playing cards on 
the
 
table
 
and
 
sends
 
that
 
information
 
to
 
PokerGFX
 
Server.
 
●
 
Connect
 
power
 
to
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
via
 
the
 
supplied
 
power
 
adapter.
 
It is essential that you use only the power adapter that is supplied with the 
table.
 
Using
 
another
 
adapter,
 
or
 
no
 
adapter
 
at
 
all,
 
will
 
cause
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
function
 
unreliably
 
and
 
could
 
cause
 
permanent
 
damage.
 
●
 
Connect
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
PC
 
with
 
a
 
USB
 
cable.
 
When using a USB Extender, please make sure you use one that requires a 
power
 
source.
 
A
 
USB
 
to
 
Ethernet
 
extender
 
is
 
available
 
for
 
purchase
 
on
 
the
 
website,
 
or
 
can
 
be
 
purchased
 
from
 
3rd
 
party
 
retailers. 
 
●
 
Double
 
click
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
icon
 
to
 
start
 
the
 
server
 
application.

There
 
are
 
two
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
hardware;
 
V1
 
(purchased
 
before
 
1
 
January
 
2018)
 
supports
 
USB
 
only;
 
V2
 
(purchased
 
after
 
1
 
January
 
2018)
 
supports
 
USB
 
and
 
WIFI
 
and
 
is
 
integrated
 
with
 
the
 
Community
 
Card
 
Antenna.
 Currently, 
the
 
WiFi
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
V2
 
Reader
 
Module
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
available,
 
however
 
it
 
is
 
still
 
supported.
 
The V2 RFID Reader can be configured differently depending on your installation 
requirements:
 
USB The RFID Reader connects via a mini USB cable to the PokerGFX Server PC.   WIFI The RFID Reader connects via WIFI to an access point that is networked with the PokerGFX Server PC. No physical cable required to connect to the PokerGFX Server. (WiFi Readers are no longer available for purchase. All new Readers are USB only.)   USB + WIFI The RFID Reader connects via a USB cable to the PokerGFX Server PC and is also connected to a WIFI access point. If the USB cable connection is removed or damaged, the RFID Reader will automatically fail over to WIFI mode, and switch back to USB when the USB cable has been restored. (WiFi Readers are no longer available for purchase. All new Readers are USB only.)
