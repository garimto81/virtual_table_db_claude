2011-2025  Outs Editor 
The Outs element works in the same way as the Player, Board and Blinds elements, 
except
 
the
 
Outs
 
element
 
dynamically
 
resizes
 
itself
 
horizontally
 
to
 
exactly
 
fit
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
outs
 
cards
 
that
 
are
 
shown.
 
The way this is handled in the editor is as follows: 
●
 
Edit
 
the
 
background
 
image
 
and
 
position
 
the
 
various
 
elements
 
on
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
the
 
Player,
 
Board
 
and
 
Ante
 
elements;
  
●
 
Design
 
your
 
background
 
image
 
to
 
fit
 
exactly
 
1
 
playing
 
card,
 
and
 
position
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
accordingly.
 
When the graphic is resized, a vertical slice of the entire height of the background 
image,
 
bounded
 
by
 
the
 
left
 
and
 
right
 
edges
 
of
 
the
 
playing
 
card
 
will
 
be
 
stretched
 
along
 
the
 
x
 
axis
 
to
 
fit
 
the
 
required
 
number
 
of
 
cards.
 
This
 
means
 
the
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image
 
behind,
 
above
 
and
 
below
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
must
 
be
 
uniform
 
along
 
the
 
x
 
axis
 
so
 
the
 
stretch
 
does
 
not
 
appear
 
to
 
distort
 
the
 
image.
 
If there are so many outs that the resulting image is too wide to fit the display 
without
 
overlapping
 
other
 
elements,
 
the
 
card
 
images
 
will
 
be
 
scaled
 
down
 
in
 
size
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
overall
 
image
 
fits.
 
If
 
this
 
happens,
 
the
 
smaller
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
re-positioned
 
on
 
the
 
y
 
axis.
 
There
 
are
 
two
 
positioning
 
options
 
to
 
choose
 
from:
 
●
 
If
 
the
 
Top
 
setting
 
for
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
is
 
anchored
 
to
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image,
 
the
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
centred
 
vertically
 
relative
 
to
 
their
 
original
 
position;
  
●
 
If
 
the
 
Top
 
setting
 
for
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
is
 
anchored
 
to
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image,
 
the
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
aligned
 
vertically
 
so
 
the
 
bottom
 
edge
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
location
 
as
 
the
 
original.
 
History Editor 
The Heads-Up Hand History graphic is another element that is dynamically resized 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
lines
 
of
 
text
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
It
 
is
 
configured
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
the
 
Leaderboard
 
element,
 
except
 
it
 
has
 
two
 
repeating
 
sections
 
instead
 
of
 
one,
 
plus
 
a
 
master
 
header
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
repeating
 
header
 
section
 
applies
 
to
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
betting
 
round
 
(Pre-Flop,
 
Flop,
 
Turn,
 
etc),
 
and
 
the
 
repeating
 
detail
 
section
 
applies
 
to
 
the
 
player
 
actions.
