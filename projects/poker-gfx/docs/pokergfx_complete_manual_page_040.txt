2011-2025  Remote Control of ATEM TV Video Switchers 
NOTE: This feature is only available with a Pro license. 
PokerGFX can control a Blackmagic ATEM Video Switcher to automatically switch 
camera
 
inputs
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
action.
 
This
 
means
 
you
 
retain
 
most
 
auto
 
camera
 
switching
 
features
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
compromise
 
on
 
video
 
quality
 
or
 
number
 
of
 
cameras.
 
Because
 
the
 
switching
 
is
 
done
 
externally
 
with
 
PokerGFX
 
only
 
controlling
 
the
 
switcher
 
rather
 
than
 
mixing
 
multiple
 
camera
 
inputs
 
internally,
 
a
 
large
 
number
 
of
 
cameras
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
without
 
any
 
performance
 
penalty
 
on
 
the
 
server
 
PC.
 
To configure ATEM control: 
●
 
Configure
 
the
 
ATEM
 
switcher
 
normally
 
and
 
ensure
 
it
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
local
 
network
 
with
 
a
 
valid
 
IP
 
address
 
(see
 
the
 
ATEM
 
user
 
manual
 
for
 
instructions
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
this).
  
●
 
Install
 
the
 
Blackmagic
 
ATEM
 
Switcher
 
software
 
on
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
PC.
  
●
 
Start
 
PokerGFX
 
Server,
 
select
 
the
 
Settings
 
->
 
Sources
 
tab.
  
●
 
Use
 
the
 
‘External
 
Switcher
 
Source’
 
setting
 
to
 
select
 
the
 
capture
 
device
 
the
 
switcher’s
 
output
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
so
 
the
 
switcher’s
 
program
 
output
 
is
 
visible
 
in
 
the
 
video
 
preview
 
window.
  
●
 
Enter
 
the
 
ATEM’s
 
IP
 
address
 
and
 
enable
 
the
 
‘ATEM
 
Control’
 
checkbox.
 
The
 
checkbox
 
will
 
turn
 
green
 
to
 
indicate
 
ATEM
 
control
 
mode
 
is
 
active.
  
●
 
A
 
list
 
of
 
all
 
camera
 
inputs
 
on
 
the
 
ATEM
 
will
 
be
 
displayed.
 
Configure
 
the
 
auto
 
camera
 
settings
 
as
 
described
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
section
 
‘Auto
 
Camera
 
Switching’:
  
/g0
 
Clicking
 
on
 
a
 
camera’s
 
name
 
allows
 
the
 
name
 
to
 
be
 
customized
 
(name
 
changes
 
are
 
automatically
 
propagated
 
to
 
the
 
ATEM
 
switcher).
  
/g0
 
Click
 
on
 
the
 
‘X’
 
column
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
camera
 
the
 
default
 
view
 
when
 
no
 
action
 
is
 
pending.
