Multiple unique player graphic element layout ‘sets’ can be defined within a single 
skin,
 
with
 
a
 
specific
 
player
 
layout
 
being
 
automatically
 
selected
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
being
 
played.
 
This enables player elements to be optimized according to the display requirements 
of
 
each
 
game
 
variant
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
manually
 
load
 
a
 
new
 
skin.
 
PokerGFX
 
supports
 
a
 
large
 
selection
 
of
 
game
 
variants,
 
each
 
variant
 
requiring
 
the
 
display
 
of
 
between
 
2
 
(Hold’Em)
 
and
 
7
 
(Stud)
 
cards.
 
The default PokerGFX skin defines 4 layouts (one for each of the 2, 3/4, 5, & 7 card 
game
 
variants),
 
however
 
it’s
 
possible
 
to
 
define
 
a
 
separate
 
layout
 
for
 
every
 
variant
 
if
 
desired
 
(or
 
even
 
one
 
default
 
layout
 
for
 
all
 
variants).

Open
 
the
 
Skin
 
Editor
 
and
 
select
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
from
 
the
 
VARIANT
 
selection
 
box.
 
The
 
player
 
layout
 
assigned
 
to
 
that
 
game
 
will
 
be
 
displayed
 
in
 
the
 
PLAYER
 
SET
 
selection
 
box.

Player
 
layout
 
sets
 
may
 
be
 
added
 
modified
 
or
 
deleted
 
with
 
the
 
NEW,
 
EDIT,
 
and
 
DELETE
 
buttons.
  
●
 
Select
 
a
 
game
 
variant,
 
then
 
select
 
the
 
desired
 
layout
 
set
 
to
 
have
 
that
 
layout
 
automatically
 
used
 
whenever
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
is
 
selected
 
before
 
a
 
hand
 
starts.

The
 
first

layout
 
cannot
 
be
 
deleted.

A
 
NEW
 
player
 
layout
 
set
 
will
 
automatically
 
inherit
 
the
 
currently
 
selected
 
layout
 
as
 
a
 
starting
 
configuration.
