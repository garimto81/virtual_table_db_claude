2011-2025  Player Status Each player is represented by a player status icon.   The player icon turns red to indicate a player is sitting in that seat, and grey when the seat is vacant.  A card graphic will appear to indicate that a player has been dealt cards. When the player folds, the card graphic is greyed out.  When a player sits out, the player icon is dimmed.
