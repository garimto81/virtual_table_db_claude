2011-2025  Show eliminated players in Leaderboard stats When disabled, only players still active are displayed in the Leaderboard. When enabled, players that have left the table or been eliminated are displayed using the alternate colour. 
  Heads Up History When players are heads-up, a graphic element appears that shows a history of all actions made by the heads up players in the current hand.   Allow Rabbit Hunting When a hand has finished that didn’t go to a showdown, additional cards placed on the community card antenna will show as ‘rabbit hunt’ cards, ie. cards that would have come out had the hand continued.   Show Chipcount % Shows each player’s stack on the Leaderboard as a percentage of total chips on the table, unless that player’s Big Blind multiple is shown.   How to display amounts Display chip counts, pots and bets in the player element as chips, BB multiple or both. 
  Unknown cards blink in Secure Mode When Secure Delay is enabled, the live preview window always displays hole cards down. When this option is enabled, cards that have not been scanned are indicated by blinking.   Limit raises to the Effective stack size If a player makes a bet (including an ALL IN) that exceeds the size of the largest stack of any other player active in the hand, the bet will be limited to the size of the largest stack. This results in a more accurate representation of the total pot size prior to a call.      
Move button after Bomb Pot At the end of each hand, the button and blinds are automatically moved in readiness for the next hand. If this option is disabled, when a Bomb Pot hand finishes the button and blinds are not moved.   Show hand equities Hand equities for each player can be displayed either from the start of the hand, or from the end of the first betting round.
