2011-2025  Adjusting Chip Counts & Cumulative Winnings 
Chip counts can be adjusted either during a hand when action is on a player (for 
example
 
a
 
player
 
goes
 
all
 
in,
 
there’s
 
a
 
chip
 
count
 
and
 
it’s
 
different
 
to
 
the
 
stack
 
size
 
in
 
PokerGFX),
 
or
 
between
 
hands
 
(chip
 
count
 
updates
 
during
 
a
 
break,
 
or
 
when
 
a
 
new
 
player
 
enters
 
the
 
game.)
 
To adjust a player stack size, use the appropriate button with the chip icon. 
Adjusting chip counts in this way does NOT change the Cumulative Winnings player 
statistic.
 
Cumulative
 
Winnings
 
is
 
adjusted
 
automatically
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
hand,
 
however
 
sometimes
 
you
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
an
 
adjustment
 
manually.
 
The
 
most
 
common
 
reason
 
for
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
side
 
bet
 
or
 
game
 
feature
 
that
 
isn’t
 
directly
 
supported
 
by
 
PokerGFX.
 
For example, the 7-Deuce bounty is supported by PokerGFX and Cumulative Winnings 
are
 
automatically
 
updated
 
to
 
reflect
 
this
 
when
 
there’s
 
a
 
winner,
 
but
 
the
 
10-Deuce
 
bounty
 
isn’t
 
supported.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
use
 
the
 
TRANSFER
 
CHIPS
 
button.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
chip
 
button
 
next
 
to
 
the
 
START
 
HAND
 
button
 
in
 
the
 
hand
 
pre-start
 
screen
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
Using this feature allows you to quickly transfer chips between players while keeping 
Cumulative
 
Winnings
 
up
 
to
 
date.
