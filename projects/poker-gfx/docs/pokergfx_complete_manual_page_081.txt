2011-2025  Custom symbols from any font can be inserted in any text by inserting a special 
sequence.
 
By
 
way
 
of
 
example,
 
the
 
'100%'
 
check
 
mark
 
is
 
represented
 
by
 
this
 
sequence:
  
 
  
\Webdings,1.4,97\
  
●
 
The
 
sequence
 
always
 
starts
 
and
 
ends
 
with
 
the
 
backslash
 
character
 
(\).
  
●
 
The
 
1st
 
parameter
 
is
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
any
 
font
 
installed
 
on
 
the
 
Windows
 
PC
 
that
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
is
 
running
 
on
 
(note
 
this
 
is
 
independent
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
skin
 
font
 
embedded
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
file,
 
so
 
you
 
must
 
ensure
 
the
 
font
 
is
 
installed
 
on
 
the
 
PC
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
production
 
(as
 
opposed
 
to
 
the
 
PC
 
the
 
skin
 
is
 
created
 
on).
 
Webdings
 
and
 
Wingdings
 
are
 
good
 
choices
 
as
 
they're
 
always
 
installed
 
with
 
the
 
default
 
Windows
 
10
 
installation).
  
●
 
The
 
2nd
 
parameter
 
is
 
the
 
size
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
symbol
 
to
 
appear,
 
as
 
a
 
multiple
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
size
 
(ie.
 
1.4
 
=
 
1.4x
 
the
 
normal
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
symbol).
 
  
●
 
The
 
3rd
 
parameter
 
is
 
the
 
numerical
 
code
 
for
 
the
 
symbol
 
in
 
the
 
font.
  An easy way of figuring out the font and code is to use the 'Insert Symbol' function in 
Microsoft
 
Word
 
-
 
select
 
'More
 
symbols',
 
select
 
the
 
font,
 
click
 
on
 
the
 
symbol
 
and
 
the
 
code
 
will
 
be
 
displayed.
