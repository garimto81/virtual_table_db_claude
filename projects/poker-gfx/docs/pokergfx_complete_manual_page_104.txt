2011-2025    Yellow Secondary and primary passwords do not match, or secondary and primary are running different versions.   Red No connection to the primary. Check that the primary server is running, the table names match and both computers are networked correctly. 
High Availability 
The MultiGFX feature can be used to guarantee high availability – that is, a 
configuration
 
where
 
downtime
 
can
 
be
 
eliminated
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
a
 
catastrophic
 
failure
 
on
 
the
 
primary
 
server.
 
Assuming the MultiGFX feature has been configured and is active when the primary 
server
 
fails,
 
the
 
link
 
status
 
icon
 
on
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX
 
will
 
turn
 
red.
 
Follow
 
this
 
procedure
 
to
 
promote
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX
 
to
 
primary
 
status:
 
●
 
If
 
applicable,
 
ensure
 
the
 
primary
 
server
 
is
 
completely
 
shut
 
down.
  
●
 
If
 
the
 
table
 
is
 
connected
 
via
 
USB
 
cable
 
to
 
the
 
primary
 
server,
 
unplug
 
it
 
and
 
plug
 
it
 
into
 
the
 
secondary
 
server
 
(skip
 
this
 
step
 
if
 
using
 
a
 
WIFI
 
table
 
connection).
  
●
 
On
 
the
 
secondary
 
server,
 
go
 
to
 
System
 
Settings
 
and
 
disable
 
the
 
MultiGFX
 
Secondary
 
checkbox.
 
This
 
will
 
reconfigure
 
it
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
server
 
and
 
force
 
it
 
to
 
connect
 
directly
 
to
 
the
 
recently
 
connected
 
table.
  
●
 
On
 
all
 
remaining
 
secondary
 
servers
 
(if
 
any),
 
disable
 
and
 
then
 
re-enable
 
the
 
‘MultiGFX’
 
checkbox
 
in
 
System
 
Settings.
 
This
 
will
 
cause
 
them
 
to
 
reconnect
 
directly
 
to
 
the
 
recently
 
promoted
 
primary
 
server.
  
●
 
Close
 
and
 
restart
 
all
 
copies
 
of
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
This
 
will
 
cause
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
to
 
reconnect
 
directly
 
to
 
the
 
recently
 
promoted
 
primary
 
server.
 
The secondary server will now be running as the primary, with all game data and 
unaired
 
delayed
 
video
 
preserved.
 
/g0
 
Playing
 
card
 
registration
 
data
 
is
 
automatically
 
propagated
 
from
 
the
 
primary
 
server
 
to
 
all
 
secondary
 
servers,
 
so
 
cards
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
registered
 
on
 
the
 
primary,
 
not
 
secondaries.
