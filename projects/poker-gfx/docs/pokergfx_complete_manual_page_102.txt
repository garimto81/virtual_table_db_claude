PokerGFX.
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
always
 
connects
 
to
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX
 
and
 
all
 
player
 
actions
 
are
 
propagated
 
to
 
the
 
secondaries
 
from
 
the
 
primary.
 
Manual
 
control
 
of
 
graphics
 
via
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
is
 
also
 
propagated
 
(for
 
example
 
displaying
 
a

Leaderboard
 
graphic).
  
●
 
Only
 
game
 
data
 
is
 
transmitted
 
to
 
the
 
secondaries
 
over
 
the
 
network.
 
The
 
background
 
video
 
must
 
be
 
fed
 
separately
 
to
 
each
 
secondary.
 
This
 
means
 
the
 
video
 
and
 
camera
 
input
 
settings
 
will
 
usually
 
be
 
different
 
on
 
each
 
secondary.
 
Here
 
are
 
two
 
common
 
scenarios:
  
Dedicated Vision Switcher Connect a second output of the program feed from the switcher to a capture device in the secondary. This ensures that the video background on both secondary and primary is synchronized.   Single Camera for the secondary Connect a stand-alone camera to the secondary, which will provide a static video background for the graphics. 
 
●
 
Each
 
copy
 
of
 
PokerGFX
 
requires
 
a
 
separate
 
computer.
 
It’s
 
not
 
possible
 
to
 
run
 
both
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
physical
 
computer.
  
●
 
All
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
computers
 
must
 
be
 
networked
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network.
  
●
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
limit
 
to
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
secondaries
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
connected
 
to
 
a
 
primary;
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
possible
 
for
 
example
 
to
 
run
 
100
 
secondaries
 
simultaneously
 
from
 
a
 
single
 
table,
 
each
 
generating
 
a
 
unique
 
video
 
stream
 
with
 
different
 
resolutions,
 
graphics
 
settings
 
and
 
delays.
  
●
 
The
 
primary
 
and
 
all
 
secondaries
 
must
 
be
 
the
 
same
 
version
 
of
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Each
 
copy
 
of
 
PokerGFX
 
must
 
be
 
separately
 
licensed.
 
A
 
separate
 
software-only
 
license
 
is
 
required
 
for
 
each
 
secondary.
 
The
 
software-only
 
license
 
is
 
provided
 
on
 
a
 
USB
 
security
 
key,
 
which
 
must
 
be
 
plugged
 
directly
 
into
 
the
 
secondary
 
computer.
