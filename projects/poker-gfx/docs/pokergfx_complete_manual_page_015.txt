2011-2025  NDI sources and outputs 
NDI (Network Device Interface) is a technology that enables video and audio to be 
sent
 
and
 
received
 
over
 
a
 
network,
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
dedicated
 
AV
 
cabling
 
and
 
other
 
infrastructure.
 
It
 
is
 
high
 
quality,
 
frame
 
accurate
 
and
 
suitable
 
for
 
use
 
in
 
a
 
live
 
production
 
environment.
 
NDI
 
is
 
supported
 
by
 
many
 
camera
 
and
 
switcher
 
vendors.
 
PokerGFX supports NDI natively for both input and output: 
●
 
Ensure
 
the
 
external
 
NDI
 
source
 
is
 
active
 
on
 
the
 
local
 
network
 
before
 
starting
 
PokerGFX
 
Server.
 
Available
 
NDI
 
sources
 
will
 
show
 
up
 
as
 
regular
 
camera
 
sources
 
on
 
the
 
Sources
 
Settings
 
tab.
  
●
 [Enterprise] Live or delayed stream output can be sent to NDI receivers on the 
local
 
network
 
simply
 
by
 
selecting
 
the
 
‘NDI
 
Renderer’
 
option
 
from
 
the
 
‘Output
 
Device’
 
dropdown
 
box
 
in
 
the
 
Outputs
 
Settings
 
tab.
