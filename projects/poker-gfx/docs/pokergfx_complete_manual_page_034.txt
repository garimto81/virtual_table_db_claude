2011-2025  System Status Icons 
The icons on the left indicate CPU and GPU usage. If they turn red, usage is too high 
for
 
the
 
Server
 
to
 
operate
 
reliably.
 
Usually
 
this
 
is
 
because
 
you
 
have
 
too
 
many
 
other
 
programs
 
running,
 
or
 
your
 
Server
 
settings
 
are
 
too
 
high.
 
Try
 
reducing
 
the
 
output
 
video
 
size
 
and
 
frame
 
rate,
 
or
 
reduce
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
cameras
 
to
 
lower
 
usage.
 
The centre icon indicates the status of the link between the Server and the RFID 
Reader:
 
Green RFID Reader is operating normally.   Grey PokerGFX Server is establishing a secure link with the RFID Reader.   Blue RFID Reader is operating normally, however there are playing cards on the table that have not yet been registered.   Black RFID Reader is operating normally, however more than one card of the same rank and suit has been detected. This indicates a card registration error, or cards from more than one deck on the table at the same time.   Magenta RFID Reader is operating normally, however duplicate cards have been detected on the table. This usually indicates a serious configuration problem with the physical layout of antennas or cables causing a single card to appear as if present on multiple antennas at the same time.   Orange RFID Reader is connected but not responding. May indicate an overloaded CPU or USB link, which could be caused by too many webcams or no table power.   Red RFID Reader is not connected.  
The icon to the right indicates whether Secure Delay is enabled. Secure Delay adds a 
security
 
delay
 
to
 
your
 
stream
 
and
 
makes
 
it
 
impossible
 
for
 
hole
 
cards
 
to
 
be
 
viewed
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
See
 
the
 
section
 
on
 
Secure
 
Delay
 
for
 
more
 
information
 
on
 
this
 
feature.
