Elements

This

for
 
example,
 
the
 
player
 
element
 
with
 
a
 
photo
 
is
 
wider
 
than
 
one
 
without.
 
If
 
the
 
photo
 
is
 
positioned
 
to
 
the
 
left
 
of
 
the
 
element,
 
all
 
other
 
elements
 
should
 
be
 
positioned
 
relative
 
to
 
the
 
right
 
hand
 
edge
 
to
 
maintain
 
correct
 
positioning
 
regardless
 
of
 
which
 
background
 
image
 
is
 
displayed.

a
 
text
 
element
 
is
 
selected,
 
additional
 
attributes
 
(font,
 
colour,

margins
 
&
 
drop
 
shadow)
 
can
 
be
 
changed.
