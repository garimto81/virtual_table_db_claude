2011-2025  Introduction 
PokerGFX is a powerful video titling software suite that generates real time poker 
graphics
 
for
 
video
 
overlay.
 
Used
 
with
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader,
 
it
 
will
 
automatically
 
detect
 
hole
 
and
 
community
 
cards
 
with
 
no
 
human
 
intervention
 
–
 
however
 
it
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
used
 
with
 
a
 
conventional
 
‘hole
 
cam’
 
table
 
by
 
entering
 
card
 
information
 
manually.
 
In RFID mode, a USB cable (or WIFI link for completely wireless operation) connects 
the
 
table
 
to
 
a
 
Windows
 
computer
 
which
 
runs
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
software.
 
The
 
server
 
communicates
 
with
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
track
 
the
 
movement
 
of
 
RFID-enabled
 
playing
 
cards
 
between
 
players,
 
and
 
converts
 
this
 
information
 
to
 
a
 
graphical
 
display
 
which
 
is
 
superimposed
 
on
 
video
 
of
 
the
 
game.
 
Tracking of betting action is possible by having the dealer or another observer enter 
player
 
actions,
 
using
 
a
 
convenient
 
touch
 
screen
 
wireless
 
tablet
 
interface
 
or
 
by
 
using
 
a
 
mouse/keyboard.
 
In
 
this
 
mode,
 
all
 
graphics
 
required
 
for
 
a
 
TV
 
broadcast
 
or
 
livestream
 
are
 
generated
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
Game video and player actions can be recorded for post-production and streamed 
live
 
with
 
an
 
optional
 
delay.
 
All technology is completely invisible to players, and special RFID-enabled playing 
cards
 
have
 
exactly
 
the
 
same
 
look
 
and
 
feel
 
as
 
high
 
quality
 
acetate
 
style
 
cards.
 
Evaluation Mode 
PokerGFX requires a USB security dongle for normal use. The dongle can be plugged 
into
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
or
 
an
 
available
 
USB
 
on
 
your
 
PC,
 
&
 
is
 
automatically
 
detected
 
when
 
PokerGFX
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
an
 
RFID
 
table.
 
When
 
purchased
 
without
 
an
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
for
 
use
 
with
 
a
 
hole
 
cam
 
table
 
or
 
in
 
MultiGFX
 
Secondary
 
mode,
 
the
 
dongle
 
is
 
shipped
 
as
 
a
 
separate
 
item,
 
and
 
must
 
be
 
plugged
 
into
 
the
 
PC
 
running
 
PokerGFX
 
at
 
all
 
times.
 
If no dongle is detected, PokerGFX runs in evaluation mode. In this mode, no features 
are
 
restricted
 
however
 
the
 
software
 
will
 
shut
 
down
 
after
 
10
 
minutes.

2011-2025  Common Usage Scenarios 
A wide range of configurations are supported to suit many applications, however 
there
 
are
 
3
 
common
 
scenarios
 
for
 
using
 
PokerGFX:
 
GFX + INTERNAL VIDEO MIX Up to 8 cameras are connected directly to the Server PC. PokerGFX automatically switches cameras to follow the action around the table and mixes video internally. No camera operators or external vision mixer required.  PokerGFX adds graphics, records & streams with an optional security delay.   GFX + EXTERNAL VIDEO MIX PokerGFX Server generates real time graphics which are keyed onto a live pre-mixed video feed from an external switcher.  PokerGFX can ingest the program feed for internal keying of graphics, or output graphics only for external keying using chroma key or separate key & fill outputs.  PokerGFX can record and stream with an optional security delay.  
/g0
 
PokerGFX
 
can
 
control
 
an
 
external
 
Blackmagic
 ATEM video switcher to automatically follow the action around the table (Pro license required). 
  POST All cards and player actions for an entire game are recorded in a live database. The Studio feature is then used to fit the hands to the timeline of the final edit of the game video. When the timeline is finished, the graphics are automatically rendered onto the video to produce the final output in post-production.

2011-2025  Video sources may be any combination of USB webcams, HD/UHD video capture 
devices
 
and
 
network
 
cameras.
 
Most
 
Windows
 
DirectShow-compatible
 
devices
 
are
 
supported.
 
USB Webcams 
Most USB webcams consume too much bandwidth on the USB controller for more 
than
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
to
 
work
 
reliably,
 
and
 
are
 
not
 
recommended.
 
For multiple webcams, the Logitech C920 is the only model that has been tested 
and
 
is
 
officially
 
supported.
 
This
 
webcam
 
offers
 
decent
 
picture
 
quality,
 
the
 
widest
 
viewing
 
angle,
 
and
 
MJPEG
 
compression
 
technology
 
that
 
reduces
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
USB
 
bandwidth
 
required.
 
/g0
 
For
 
maximum
 
reliability,
 
it
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
install
 
multiple
 
USB
 
controller
 
cards
 
in
 
the
 
server
 
PC,
 
and
 
connect
 
no
 
more
 
than
 
2
 
webcams
 
to
 
each.
 
Capture Devices 
Any video capture device that is compliant with Windows DirectShow WDM may be 
used,
 
however
 
there
 
is
 
optimized
 
support
 
for
 
Blackmagic
 
Decklink
 
cards,
 
and
 
these
 
are
 
recommended
 
for
 
best
 
reliability
 
and
 
picture
 
quality.
 
/g0
 
A
 
Blackmagic
 
Decklink
 
Duo
 
2
 
card
 
will
 
provide
 
4
 
full
 
HD
 
inputs
 
at
 
1080p60,
 
and
 
is
 
the
 
recommended
 
capture
 
device
 
for
 
broadcast
 
quality
 
systems.
 
Network cameras 
Remote network cameras that support RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols are 
supported
 
and
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as

2011-2025  NDI sources and outputs 
NDI (Network Device Interface) is a technology that enables video and audio to be 
sent
 
and
 
received
 
over
 
a
 
network,
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
dedicated
 
AV
 
cabling
 
and
 
other
 
infrastructure.
 
It
 
is
 
high
 
quality,
 
frame
 
accurate
 
and
 
suitable
 
for
 
use
 
in
 
a
 
live
 
production
 
environment.
 
NDI
 
is
 
supported
 
by
 
many
 
camera
 
and
 
switcher
 
vendors.
 
PokerGFX supports NDI natively for both input and output: 
●
 
Ensure
 
the
 
external
 
NDI
 
source
 
is
 
active
 
on
 
the
 
local
 
network
 
before
 
starting

2011-2025  RFID Reader 
The RFID Reader collects data about the position of RFID enabled playing cards on 
the
 
table
 
and
 
sends
 
that
 
information
 
to
 
PokerGFX
 
Server.
 
●
 
Connect
 
power
 
to
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
via
 
the
 
supplied
 
power
 
adapter.
 
It is essential that you use only the power adapter that is supplied with the 
table.
 
Using
 
another
 
adapter,
 
or
 
no
 
adapter
 
at
 
all,
 
will
 
cause
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
function
 
unreliably
 
and
 
could
 
cause
 
permanent
 
damage.
 
●
 
Connect
 
the
 
table
 
to
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
PC
 
with
 
a
 
USB
 
cable.
 
When using a USB Extender, please make sure you use one that requires a 
power
 
source.
 
A
 
USB
 
to
 
Ethernet
 
extender
 
is
 
available
 
for
 
purchase
 
on
 
the

There
 
are
 
two
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
RFID
 
Reader
 
hardware;
 
V1
 
(purchased
 
before
 
1
 
January
 
2018)
 
supports
 
USB
 
only;
 
V2
 
(purchased
 
after
 
1
 
January
 
2018)
 
supports
 
USB
 
and
 
WIFI
 
and
 
is
 
integrated
 
with
 
the
 
Community
 
Card
 
Antenna.
 Currently, 
the
 
WiFi
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
V2
 
Reader
 
Module
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
available,
 
however
 
it
 
is
 
still
 
supported.
 
The V2 RFID Reader can be configured differently depending on your installation 
requirements:
 
USB The RFID Reader connects via a mini USB cable to the PokerGFX Server PC.   WIFI The RFID Reader connects via WIFI to an access point that is networked with the PokerGFX Server PC. No physical cable required to connect to the PokerGFX Server. (WiFi Readers are no longer available for purchase. All new Readers are USB only.)   USB + WIFI The RFID Reader connects via a USB cable to the PokerGFX Server PC and is also connected to a WIFI access point. If the USB cable connection is removed or damaged, the RFID Reader will automatically fail over to WIFI mode, and switch back to USB when the USB cable has been restored. (WiFi Readers are no longer available for purchase. All new Readers are USB only.)

Checking
 
the
 
‘Ignore
 
Tags’
 
box
 
will
 
cause
 
the
 
Server
 
to
 
operate
 
in
 
tag-less
 
mode.
 
In
 
this
 
mode,
 
player
 
ID
 
cards
 
are
 
ignored
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
possible
 
to
 
manually
 
enter
 
player
 
names
 
using
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
In order for the Server to display the correct player names on the graphic overlay, 
each
 
player
 
must
 
identify
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
sitting
 
at
 
the
 
table.
 
This
 
is
 
done
 
by
 
issuing
 
an
 
identity
 
card
 
to
 
each
 
player.
 
To
 
make
 
a
 
new
 
player
 
identity
 
card:
 
●
 
Ensure
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
cards
 
on
 
either
 
of
 
the
 
Muck
 
positions;
  
●
 
Locate
 
the
 
input
 
text
 
box
 
in
 
the
 
Server
 
window
 
underneath
 
the
 
‘Tag
 
Player’
 
button,
 
and
 
enter
 
the
 
new
 
player’s
 
name;
  
●
 
Click
 
the
 
‘Tag
 
Player’
 
button;
  
●
 
Place
 
a
 
blank
 
identity
 
card
 
on
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
Muck
 
positions
 
on
 
the
 
playing
 
surface;
  
●
 
A
 
beep
 
will
 
sound
 
and
 
the
 
text
 
box
 
will
 
clear.
 
The
 
card
 
has
 
been
 
registered
 
with
 
the
 
player’s
 
name.
  
/g0
 
When
 
a
 
player
 
joins
 
a
 
game,
 
he
 
or
 
she
 
must
 
place
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
identity
 
card
 
on
 
the
 
player
 
antenna
 
for
 
a
 
few
 
seconds.
  
During the Game 
A few rules must be observed to enable the Server to track the action correctly: 
●
 
Players
 
must
 
place
 
their
 
cards
 
on
 
the
 
marked
 
antenna
 
area
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
them
 
(except
 
when
 
peeking)
  
/g0
 
Cards
 
should
 
be
 
fanned
 
out
 
or
 
placed
 
side
 
by
 
side
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
 
for
 
best
 
reading
 
performance.

a
 
separate
 
empty
 
folder.
 
All

If
 
recording
 
is
 
interrupted,

Supported recording modes 
The recording mode can be selected from the ‘Outputs’ settings tab: 
Game data only (no video). Typically used for rendering hands in post production where game video has been recorded outside PokerGFX. Game data with video and GFX. This is the same as the live stream. Game data with video but no GFX. This is commonly used when the game is streamed live with graphics, but ‘clean’ video is recorded with no graphics. Graphics are added in post production using the recorded hand data.

2011-2025  Action Clock 
Action Clock is an app that can be downloaded separately and run on a low cost 
Windows
 
tablet.
 
It
 
is
 
a
 
lightweight
 
yet
 
fully
 
featured
 
player
 
shot
 
clock
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
controlled
 
directly
 
by
 
the
 
dealer.
 
Extremely
 
simple
 
to
 
use
 
with
 
large
 
buttons
 
and
 
a
 
clock
 
display
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
oriented
 
either
 
towards
 
the
 
dealer
 
or
 
towards
 
the
 
players,
 
it
 
only
 
has
 
4
 
functions
 
–
 
Start/Reset
 
Clock,
 
Pause
 
Clock,
 
Stop
 
Clock
 
and
 
Add
 
Time.
 
Action Clock can either be used continuously in turbo games where each player has a 
maximum
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
to
 
act,
 
or
 
on
 
an
 
as
 
needed
 
basis
 
when
 
someone
 
‘calls
 
the
 
clock’
 
on
 
another
 
player.
 
It
 
is
 
fully
 
configurable,
 
with
 
optional
 
warning
 
sounds.
 
Action Clock does not require a PokerGFX Server to operate, however when a server 
is
 
detected
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
local
 
network,
 
the
 
clock
 
status
 
is
 
automatically
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
Server.
 
 
NOTE: This feature is only available with a Pro server license. 
In this mode, PokerGFX will automatically display the number of seconds players have 
left
 
to
 
act
 
whenever
 
the
 
timer
 
reaches
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
seconds
 
specified
 
in
 
the
 
Graphics
 
Settings
 
->
 
Action
 
Clock
 
setting.
 
The
 
timer
 
is
 
also
 
displayed
 
if
 
the
 
Action
 
Clock
 
‘Add
 
Time’
 
button
 
is
 
used.
 
Action Clock can be downloaded from the videopokertable.net website.

2011-2025  System Status Icons 
The icons on the left indicate CPU and GPU usage. If they turn red, usage is too high 
for
 
the
 
Server
 
to
 
operate
 
reliably.
 
Usually
 
this
 
is
 
because
 
you
 
have
 
too
 
many
 
other
 
programs
 
running,
 
or
 
your
 
Server
 
settings
 
are
 
too
 
high.
 
Try
 
reducing
 
the
 
output
 
video
 
size
 
and
 
frame
 
rate,
 
or
 
reduce
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
cameras
 
to
 
lower
 
usage.
 
The centre icon indicates the status of the link between the Server and the RFID 
Reader:
 
Green RFID Reader is operating normally.   Grey PokerGFX Server is establishing a secure link with the RFID Reader.   Blue RFID Reader is operating normally, however there are playing cards on the table that have not yet been registered.   Black RFID Reader is operating normally, however more than one card of the same rank and suit has been detected. This indicates a card registration error, or cards from more than one deck on the table at the same time.   Magenta RFID Reader is operating normally, however duplicate cards have been detected on the table. This usually indicates a serious configuration problem with the physical layout of antennas or cables causing a single card to appear as if present on multiple antennas at the same time.   Orange RFID Reader is connected but not responding. May indicate an overloaded CPU or USB link, which could be caused by too many webcams or no table power.   Red RFID Reader is not connected.  
The icon to the right indicates whether Secure Delay is enabled. Secure Delay adds a 
security
 
delay
 
to
 
your
 
stream
 
and
 
makes
 
it
 
impossible
 
for
 
hole
 
cards
 
to
 
be
 
viewed
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
See

2011-2025  Camera Transitions 
When the ‘Crossfade’ setting is zero, camera sources transition with a hard cut. 
Setting
 
this
 
value
 
to
 
a
 
higher
 
value
 
between
 
0.1
 
and
 
2.0
 
causes
 
sources
 
to
 
crossfade,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
softer,
 
more
 
fluid
 
transition.
 
The
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
setting
 
is
 
time
 
taken
 
for
 
a
 
crossfade
 
to
 
complete,
 
in
 
seconds
 
(ie.
 
higher
 
value
 
is
 
slower).
 
Board Sync 
Delays the detection of community cards by the specified number of milliseconds. 
This
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
compensate
 
for
 
the
 
problem
 
where
 
community
 
card
 
graphics
 
are
 
displayed
 
before
 
the
 
cards
 
are
 
shown
 
being
 
dealt
 
on
 
video.
 
This
 
phenomenon
 
is
 
caused
 
in
 
some
 
environments
 
with
 
high
 
video
 
latency
 
introduced
 
by
 
external
 
switching
 
and
 
conversion
 
equipment.
 
Using an External Switcher 
When using a camera source for video capture from an external vision switcher, 
select
 
this
 
capture
 
device
 
using
 
the
 
'External
 
Switcher
 
Source'
 
dropdown
 
box.
 
This
 
disables
 
the
 
built-in
 
multi-camera
 
switching
 
features
 
(except
 
when
 
using
 
ATEM
 
control,
 
where
 
an
 
external
 
video
 
switcher
 
can
 
be
 
controlled
 
by
 
PokerGFX).
 
Audio Input 
Select the desired audio capture device and volume. The Sync setting adjusts the 
timing
 
of
 
the
 
audio
 
signal
 
to
 
match
 
the
 
video,
 
if
 
required.

2011-2025  Remote Control of ATEM TV Video Switchers 
NOTE: This feature is only available with a Pro license. 
PokerGFX can control a Blackmagic ATEM Video Switcher to automatically switch 
camera
 
inputs
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
action.
 
This
 
means
 
you
 
retain
 
most
 
auto
 
camera
 
switching
 
features
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
compromise
 
on
 
video
 
quality
 
or
 
number
 
of
 
cameras.
 
Because
 
the
 
switching
 
is
 
done
 
externally
 
with
 
PokerGFX
 
only
 
controlling
 
the
 
switcher
 
rather
 
than
 
mixing
 
multiple
 
camera
 
inputs
 
internally,
 
a
 
large
 
number
 
of
 
cameras
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
without
 
any
 
performance
 
penalty
 
on
 
the
 
server
 
PC.
 
To configure ATEM control: 
●
 
Configure
 
the
 
ATEM
 
switcher
 
normally
 
and
 
ensure
 
it
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
local
 
network
 
with
 
a
 
valid
 
IP
 
address
 
(see
 
the
 
ATEM
 
user
 
manual
 
for
 
instructions
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
do
 
this).

2011-2025  Auto Delay 
This feature will turn secure delay on as soon as the first hand is detected, then stop 
it
 
after
 
a
 
period
 
of
 
inactivity.
 
To
 
enable,
 
set
 
the

box
 
to
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
minutes
 
of

a
 
value
 
greater
 
than

2011-2025  Dynamic Delay 
NOTE: This option is only available with a Pro server license. 
The Dynamic Delay feature automatically skips tourney breaks during a delayed 
stream
 
by
 
starting
 
with
 
a
 
much
 
longer
 
delay
 
which
 
is
 
progressively
 
reduced
 
every
 
time
 
there's
 
a
 
break.
 
To use this feature, enable the 'Dynamic Delay' checkbox in Output Settings and enter 
the
 
starting
 
delay
 
in
 
minutes.
 
The
 
starting
 
delay
 
is
 
the
 
total
 
length
 
of
 
all
 
breaks
 
expected
 
to
 
occur
 
during
 
the
 
stream
 
PLUS
 
the
 
normal
 
security
 
delay
 
you
 
use.
 
When this mode is active, the 'Secure Delay' value which normally determines the 
fixed
 
security
 
delay
 
(typically
 
15
 
-
 
30
 
minutes)
 
becomes
 
the
 
MINIMUM
 
delay.
 
Every
 
time
 
there's
 
a
 
break
 
between
 
hands
 
of
 
greater
 
than
 
10
 
minutes,
 
the
 
delay
 
is
 
reduced
 
until
 
the
 
minimum
 
delay
 
value
 
is
 
reached.
 
/g0
 
Example:
 
You're
 
streaming
 
a
 
tourney
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
15
 
minute
 
break
 
every
 
2
 
hour
 
level.
 
The
 
stream
 
will
 
last
 
5
 
hours,
 
and
 
your
 
'Secure
 
Delay'
 
setting
 
is
 
30
 
minutes.
 
The
 
'Dynamic
 
Delay'
 
value
 
should
 
be
 
(2
 
breaks
 
X
 
15
 
minutes)
 
+
 
30
 
minutes
 
=
 
60
 
minutes.
 
Your
 
delay
 
will
 
start
 
at
 
60
 
minutes
 
and
 
gradually
 
reduce
 
to
 
30
 
minutes
 
by
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the

2011-2025  Graphics (GFX 1, GFX 2 & GFX 3) 
Use these settings to customize the graphic overlay. 
Board Position Position of the Board graphic (shows community cards, pot size and optionally blind levels). Choices are LEFT, CENTRE and RIGHT. The Board is always positioned at the bottom of the display.   Player Layout Select one of 5 layout options, which determine the positioning of player graphics:  Horizontal – players are arranged horizontally along the bottom of the display, board cards centred above players. This setting is optimised for use with the split screen webcam mode.  Vert/Bot/Spill – Players are arranged vertically starting from the bottom left corner of the display. When the left side is full, players fill up from the bottom right corner.  Vert/Bot/Fit – Players are arranged vertically starting from the bottom left corner of the display. If necessary, players are reduced in size to ensure they all fit on the left hand side.  Vert/Top/Spill – Players are arranged vertically starting from the top left corner of the display. When the left side is full, players fill up from the top right corner.  Vert/Top/Fit – Players are arranged vertically starting from the top left corner of the display. If necessary, players are reduced in size to ensure they all fit on the left hand side.  
/g0
 
In
 
all
 
vertical
 
layout
 
modes,
 
players
 
are
 
always
 
displayed
 
in
 clockwise table order starting from the first player to act, provided the system is running in Action Tracker mode. 
  Heads Up layout Left / Right Overrides the player layout when players are heads-up. In this mode, the board graphic is positioned at the bottom centre of the display with each player positioned either side. This layout is great for Heads Up tournaments or final tables where the final 2 heads-up players are relocated so they're on opposite sides of a single camera shot.

2011-2025  Heads Up custom Y-position Use this to specify the vertical position of player graphics when Heads Up layout is active. Handy for productions that use a triple panel view with Heads Up players in the top half of the display and the flop underneath.  
Leaderboard Position Selects the position of the Leaderboard graphic. 
  Reveal Players Determines when players are shown:  Setting Auto Mode Action Tracker Mode Immediate Players are shown as cards are dealt. Players are shown as cards are dealt. 
On Action Players are shown as cards are dealt. Players are shown only when it is their first turn to act. 
After Bet Players are shown after the flop. Players are shown only after their first bet or call. A player that folds pre-flop will not be shown. On Action + Next Players are shown as cards are dealt. Same as ‘On Action’, with the addition that the next player to act is also shown.    Skin Editor Open the Skin Editor (see the ‘Skins’ section for more information).   Media Folder Configures the location of the Media folder, which contains player photos and other videos.   X Margin This setting controls the size of the horizontal margins. Valid values are between 0 and 1. When in any vertical layout mode, larger values cause all graphics to move towards the centre of the display. This is useful for cropping the entire layout into a smaller zone in the centre of the video.   Y Margin (Top & Bottom) This setting controls the size of the vertical margins. Valid values are between 0 and 1. Larger values cause all graphics to move towards the centre of the display.

Trailing Currency Symbol Displays the currency symbol to the right of the amount, instead of to the left. 
  Divide all amounts by 100 Causes all chip amounts to be divided by 100 before display. This permits the use of very small denomination chips (0.25, 0.50 etc). In this mode, enter all chip amounts in Action Tracker in cents (eg. $0.25 would be entered as 25; $10 would be entered as $1000).   Show knockout rank Displays the rank of eliminated players on the chip count display. If Payouts have been entered, payouts for each eliminated player are also displayed.   Show as Eliminated Displays the message ELIMINATED on a player graphic if that players stack is reduced to zero.

2011-2025  Show eliminated players in Leaderboard stats When disabled, only players still active are displayed in the Leaderboard. When enabled, players that have left the table or been eliminated are displayed using the alternate colour. 
  Heads Up History When players are heads-up, a graphic element appears that shows a history of all actions made by the heads up players in the current hand.   Allow Rabbit Hunting When a hand has finished that didn’t go to a showdown, additional cards placed on the community card antenna will show as ‘rabbit hunt’ cards, ie. cards that would have come out had the hand continued.   Show Chipcount % Shows each player’s stack on the Leaderboard as a percentage of total chips on the table, unless that player’s Big Blind multiple is shown.   How to display amounts Display chip counts, pots and bets in the player element as chips, BB multiple or both. 
  Unknown cards blink in Secure Mode When Secure Delay is enabled, the live preview window always displays hole cards down. When this option is enabled, cards that have not been scanned are indicated by blinking.   Limit raises to the Effective stack size If a player makes a bet (including an ALL IN) that exceeds the size of the largest stack of any other player active in the hand, the bet will be limited to the size of the largest stack. This results in a more accurate representation of the total pot size prior to a call.      
Move button after Bomb Pot At the end of each hand, the button and blinds are automatically moved in readiness for the next hand. If this option is disabled, when a Bomb Pot hand finishes the button and blinds are not moved.   Show hand equities Hand equities for each player can be displayed either from the start of the hand, or from the end of the first betting round.

The appearance and behaviour of the PIP can be modified in the Editor: 
Max Time This setting limits the amount of time the PIP is active when there are long gaps between hands. Setting this value to zero will cause the PIP to show at all times in between hands. A value of 5 will hide the PIP after 5 seconds.   Border A border of any colour and thickness can be drawn around the PIP area by selecting a non-zero ‘size’ value.   Opacity Use the slider bar to set the opacity of the PIP. Lower values make the PIP more ‘see through’.   Auto Centre When enabled, this setting forces the PIP output area to be automatically centred in the video window at all times.   Refresh Refreshes both the local video and remote computer images.

2011-2025  System 
Check for Updates Force the Server to check to see if there’s a software update available. 
  Action Tracker Kiosk When the Server starts, Action Tracker is automatically started on the same PC on the secondary display in kiosk mode. In this mode, AT cannot be closed or minimised, and the Video and Delay Insert consoles are disabled.  When used in conjunction with a touch enabled display, this is a cost effective and secure way of making AT available without the need for a secondary PC, laptop or tablet.  All in one USB touchscreen displays are perfect for this application, such as the Mimo monitors available from:  http://www.mimomonitors.com   Auto Start Automatically start the PokerGFX Server when Windows starts. Useful for unattended installations.   Allow Action Tracker access ‘Track the action’ can only be started from Action Tracker if this option is enabled. When disabled, Action Tracker may still be used but only in Auto mode - player names can be edited but Action Tracking mode cannot be started.   MultiGFX Forces PokerGFX to sync to another primary PokerGFX running on a different, networked computer, making it possible to generate multiple live and delayed video streams with different graphics, from the same table. See the chapter on ‘MultiGFX’.   Sync Stream  When in MultiGFX mode, forces secure delay to start and stop in synchronization with the primary server. 
  Sync Skin Causes the secondary MultiGFX server skin to auto update from the skin that is currently active on the primary server.   No Cards Enable this on the primary MultiGFX server as an additional layer of security. When enabled, no hole card information will be shared with any secondary server.

2011-2025  Ignore Name Tags When enabled, player ID tags are ignored; player names are entered manually in Action Tracker.   UPCARD antennas read hole cards draw & flop games Enables all antennas configured for reading UPCARDS in STUD games to also detect hole cards when playing any flop or draw game, expanding the size of the effective card reading area for each player to include both the regular hole card antenna as well as the UPCARD antenna. When this feature is disabled these antennas are only active during STUD games. 
  Disable Muck Causes the muck antenna to be disabled when in Action Tracker mode. This can make following the action more intuitive when in certain card reveal modes.   Secure Delay Folder By default the files that are generated when the Secure Delay feature is active are stored in the current user’s Windows temporary files folder. These files occupy approximately 50 GB of space for a video size of 1920 x 1080, which can cause a problem if the Windows drive is small or low on space. Click the ‘Secure Delay Folder’ button to specify a storage folder on a different drive.

2011-2025  Skins 
NOTE: This option is only available with a Pro license. 
A skin is a visual theme for the graphic overlay. It is consistent across all of the 
individual
 
graphic
 
elements
 
and
 
gives
 
your
 
production
 
an
 
overall
 
‘look
 
and
 
feel’.
 
Skins
 
contain
 
definitions
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
graphics,
 
the
 
font,
 
and
 
positioning
 
of
 
each
 
individual
 
element,
 
and
 
are
 
easily
 
transportable
 
as
 
a
 
single
 
file
 
across
 
multiple
 
computers.
 
To
 
use
 
a
 
skin
 
all
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
copy
 
the
 
skin
 
file
 
to
 
the
 
server
 
computer
 
and
 
import
 
it.
 
Access the Skins Manager by clicking the ‘Skin’ button in Graphics settings. The 
bottom
 
buttons
 
perform
 
various
 
administrative
 
functions:
 
Reset to Default Reset the current skin to default values. This will cause the current skin settings to be overwritten.   Export Export the current skin to a skin file that can be imported on another computer.   Import Import a skin file. This will cause the current skin settings to be overwritten.   Use Save the skin settings and close the Skin Manager. Use this option to test the look of your skin.   Discard Discard any changes to the current skin and close the Skin Manager.

All
 
prebuilt
 
skins
 
are
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
Downloads
 
section
 
of
 
the

cost.
 
The top buttons provide access to the functions which are used to modify the visual 
look
 
of
 
each

Any TrueType font may be used. To use a font, install it on the computer that the skin

Chroma Keying semi-transparent skins 
Some video mixers do not handle semi-transparent graphics well when chroma 
keying,
 
and
 
semi-transparent
 
images
 
often
 
become
 
partially
 
invisible.
 
When the ‘Remove Partial Transparency When Chroma Key Enabled’ checkbox is 
enabled,
 
all
 
semi-transparent
 
portions
 
of
 
images
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
are
 
made
 
opaque
 
by
 
adjusting
 
the
 
alpha
 
channel
 
only
 
for
 
those
 
areas.
 
This
 
effect
 
is
 
only
 
applied
 
when
 
the
 
Video
 
Sources
 
->
 
Chroma
 
Key
 
feature
 
is
 
enabled. 
/g0
 
This
 
feature
 
does
 
not
 
completely
 
disable
 
transparency;
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
image
 
which
 
are
 
100%
 
transparent
 
will
 
remain
 
transparent,
 
preserving
 
the
 
look
 
of
 
deliberately
 
see-through
 
areas
 
(for
 
example
 
rounded
 
corners).
 
UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) skins 
Skins developed before support for 4k video resolution was added were designed to 
fit
 
a
 
1920
 
x
 
1080
 
display,
 
and
 
are
 
auto
 
downscaled
 
to
 
fit
 
lower
 
resolutions
 
such
 
as
 
1280
 
x
 
720
 
as
 
required.
 
These
 
older
 
skins
 
are
 
upscaled
 
when
 
3840
 
x
 
2160
 
is
 
selected
 
as
 
the
 
video
 
resolution,
 
but
 
this
 
results
 
in
 
an
 
unavoidable
 
loss
 
of
 
quality.
 
All new skins should be designed to fit a 3840 x 2160 display, which will result in the 
best
 
possible
 
quality
 
at
 
all
 
resolutions.
 
Skins
 
that
 
contain
 
graphic
 
elements
 
sized
 
to
 
fit
 
4k
 
should
 
have
 
the
 
‘Designed
 
for
 
4K
 
(3840
 
x
 
2160)’
 
checkbox
 
enabled.
 
Size Adjustment 
Click and drag the ‘Adjust Size’ trackbar to quickly adjust the size of all the graphic 
elements
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
without
 
modifying
 
the
 
actual
 
images.

Multiple unique player graphic element layout ‘sets’ can be defined within a single 
skin,
 
with
 
a
 
specific
 
player
 
layout
 
being
 
automatically
 
selected
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
being
 
played.
 
This enables player elements to be optimized according to the display requirements 
of
 
each
 
game
 
variant
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
manually
 
load
 
a
 
new
 
skin.
 
PokerGFX
 
supports
 
a
 
large
 
selection
 
of
 
game
 
variants,
 
each
 
variant
 
requiring
 
the
 
display
 
of
 
between
 
2
 
(Hold’Em)
 
and
 
7
 
(Stud)
 
cards.
 
The default PokerGFX skin defines 4 layouts (one for each of the 2, 3/4, 5, & 7 card 
game
 
variants),
 
however
 
it’s
 
possible
 
to
 
define
 
a
 
separate
 
layout
 
for
 
every
 
variant
 
if
 
desired
 
(or
 
even
 
one
 
default
 
layout
 
for
 
all
 
variants).
 
●
 
Open
 
the
 
Skin
 
Editor
 
and
 
select
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
from
 
the
 
VARIANT
 
selection
 
box.
 
The
 
player
 
layout
 
assigned
 
to
 
that
 
game
 
will
 
be
 
displayed
 
in
 
the
 
PLAYER
 
SET
 
selection
 
box.
 
  
●
 
Player
 
layout
 
sets
 
may
 
be
 
added
 
modified
 
or
 
deleted
 
with
 
the
 
NEW,
 
EDIT,
 
and
 
DELETE
 
buttons.
  
●
 
Select
 
a
 
game
 
variant,
 
then
 
select
 
the
 
desired
 
layout
 
set
 
to
 
have
 
that
 
layout
 
automatically
 
used
 
whenever
 
the
 
game
 
variant
 
is
 
selected
 
before
 
a
 
hand
 
starts.
  
/g0
 
The
 
first
 
DEFAULT
 
layout
 
cannot
 
be
 
deleted.
  
/g0
 
A
 
NEW
 
player
 
layout
 
set
 
will
 
automatically
 
inherit
 
the
 
currently
 
selected
 
layout
 
as
 
a
 
starting
 
configuration.

2011-2025  Custom Animations 
Many graphic elements support custom animation from a sequence of user supplied 
PNG
 
images.
 
Custom
 
animations
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
achieve
 
effects
 
like
 
player
 
graphics
 
‘unfolding’
 
onto
 
the
 
screen,
 
and
 
then
 
animating
 
a
 
moving
 
bar
 
while
 
waiting
 
for
 
a
 
player
 
to
 
act.
 
Where
 
supported,
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
separate
 
animations
 
can
 
be
 
configured
 
for
 
each
 
element
 
background
 
image:
 
AnimIn Custom animation that replaces the default ‘Transition In’ animation (Slide, Pop, Fade, Expand). Runs when the element first appears on screen.  
/g0
 
The
 
automatic
 
glint
 
and
 
optional
 
bounce
 
effects
 
that
 
are
 normally applied after the ‘Trans In’ animation has completed are disabled when a custom AnimIn animation is enabled. 
Loop Custom animation that runs continuously while the element is on screen, after AnimIn or the selected ‘Transition In’ animation has completed. AnimOut same as AnimIn, but replaces the default ‘Transition Out’ animation. Runs when the element is removed from the screen.  
Custom animations are available for most graphic elements: 
 AnimIn  Loop AnimOut Blinds Yes Yes Yes Board Yes Yes Yes Player Yes Yes Yes Action Clock Yes Yes Yes Field Yes Yes Yes Outs No No No Heads Up History No No No Leaderboard Yes Yes Yes Ticker No Yes No

2011-2025  Leaderboard Editor 
The Leaderboard editor works in the same way as the Player, Board and Blinds 
editors,
 
with
 
one
 
notable
 
difference.
 
The
 
Leaderboard
 
element
 
dynamically
 
resizes
 
itself
 
to
 
exactly
 
fit
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
The leaderboard element comprises 3 separate images; a header, a repeating section 
and
 
a
 
footer.
 
The
 
header
 
is
 
composited
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
leaderboard,
 
the
 
repeating
 
section
 
is
 
replicated
 
as
 
many
 
times
 
as
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
exactly
 
accommodate
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
below
 
that,
 
and
 
finally
 
the
 
footer
 
is
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
bottom.
 
●
 
Design
 
3
 
separate
 
images
 
–
 
header,
 
repeating
 
section
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
repeating
 
section
 
must
 
be
 
sized
 
to
 
fit
 
a
 
single
 
line
 
or
 
player.
  
/g0
 
These
 
3
 
images
 
must
 
be
 
the
 
same
 
width.
  
●
 
Import
 
these
 
background
 
images
 
one
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
by
 
selecting
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
image
 
and
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Import’
 
button.

For
 
the
 
header
 
image
 
position
 
the
 
Title,
 
Game
 
Title
 
and
 
Player
 
Photo
 
elements.
 
For
 
the
 
repeating

position
 
the

Right

and
 
finally
 
position
 
the
 
footer
 
text
 
on
 
the
 
footer
 
image.
  
A custom AnimIn sequence will only be enabled when AnimIn sequences are added 
to
 
all
 
3
 
images
 
(header,
 
repeat
 
&
 
footer).
 
It’s
 
not
 
possible
 
to
 
add
 
an
 
AnimIn
 
sequence
 
for
 
only
 
the
 
header
 
and
 
not
 
the
 
repeat
 
section
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
same
 
rule
 
applies
 
to
 
AnimOut
 
sequences,
 
but
 
not
 
the
 
Loop
 
animation.

2011-2025  Strip Editor 
The Strip is graphic element that displays all players across the top of the screen 
along
 
with
 
chip
 
counts
 
and
 
position.
 
It
 
is
 
resized
 
dynamically
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
The Strip editor is the same as the Player, Board and Blinds editor. The composited 
element
 
you
 
produce
 
will
 
be
 
replicated
 
in
 
a
 
horizontal
 
row
 
and
 
scaled
 
if
 
necessary
 
to
 
accommodate
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.

2011-2025  Outs Editor 
The Outs element works in the same way as the Player, Board and Blinds elements, 
except
 
the
 
Outs
 
element
 
dynamically
 
resizes
 
itself
 
horizontally
 
to
 
exactly
 
fit
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
outs
 
cards
 
that
 
are
 
shown.
 
The way this is handled in the editor is as follows: 
●
 
Edit
 
the
 
background
 
image
 
and
 
position
 
the
 
various
 
elements
 
on
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
the
 
Player,
 
Board
 
and
 
Ante
 
elements;
  
●
 
Design
 
your
 
background
 
image
 
to
 
fit
 
exactly
 
1
 
playing
 
card,
 
and
 
position
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
accordingly.
 
When the graphic is resized, a vertical slice of the entire height of the background 
image,
 
bounded
 
by
 
the
 
left
 
and
 
right
 
edges
 
of
 
the
 
playing
 
card
 
will
 
be
 
stretched
 
along
 
the
 
x
 
axis
 
to
 
fit
 
the
 
required
 
number
 
of
 
cards.
 
This
 
means
 
the
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image
 
behind,
 
above
 
and
 
below
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
must
 
be
 
uniform
 
along
 
the
 
x
 
axis
 
so
 
the
 
stretch
 
does
 
not
 
appear
 
to
 
distort
 
the
 
image.
 
If there are so many outs that the resulting image is too wide to fit the display 
without
 
overlapping
 
other
 
elements,
 
the
 
card
 
images
 
will
 
be
 
scaled
 
down
 
in
 
size
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
overall
 
image
 
fits.
 
If
 
this
 
happens,
 
the
 
smaller
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
re-positioned
 
on
 
the
 
y
 
axis.
 
There
 
are
 
two
 
positioning
 
options
 
to
 
choose
 
from:
 
●
 
If
 
the
 
Top
 
setting
 
for
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
is
 
anchored
 
to
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image,
 
the
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
centred
 
vertically
 
relative
 
to
 
their
 
original
 
position;
  
●
 
If
 
the
 
Top
 
setting
 
for
 
the
 
card
 
element
 
is
 
anchored
 
to
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
background
 
image,
 
the
 
cards
 
will
 
be
 
aligned
 
vertically
 
so
 
the
 
bottom
 
edge
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
location
 
as
 
the
 
original.
 
History Editor 
The Heads-Up Hand History graphic is another element that is dynamically resized 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
lines
 
of
 
text
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
It
 
is
 
configured
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
the
 
Leaderboard
 
element,
 
except
 
it
 
has
 
two
 
repeating
 
sections
 
instead
 
of
 
one,
 
plus
 
a
 
master
 
header
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
repeating
 
header
 
section
 
applies
 
to
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
betting
 
round
 
(Pre-Flop,
 
Flop,
 
Turn,
 
etc),
 
and
 
the
 
repeating
 
detail
 
section
 
applies
 
to
 
the
 
player
 
actions.

2011-2025  Cards 
A skin can contain multiple card sets. A card set consists of 52 fronts or faces, a card 
back
 
and
 
a
 
special
 
‘rabbit’
 
overlay.
 
 
/g0
 
The
 
rabbit
 
overlay
 
should
 
be
 
an
 
image
 
the
 
same
 
size
 
as
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
card
 
images,
 
with
 
a
 
mainly
 
transparent
 
or
 
semi-transparent
 
background
 
and
 
a
 
bold
 
‘X’
 
or
 
similar
 
symbol
 
to
 
indicate
 
a
 
card
 
is
 
not
 
valid.
 
It
 
is
 
composited
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
another
 
card
 
under
 
certain
 
circumstances.
 
Skins commonly contain 1 or 2 card sets (however there’s no limit to the number of 
sets).
 
Where
 
there
 
are
 
2
 
card
 
sets,
 
typically
 
one
 
will
 
contain
 
black
 
and
 
red
 
cards
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
will
 
contain
 
four
 
colour
 
cards.
 
Create a card set by placing 53 PNG images in an empty folder, named according to 
the
 
below
 
table.
 
To import the cards, add a new card set by clicking the ‘Add’ button. Replace the 
currently
 
selected
 
card
 
set
 
by
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Replace’
 
button.

2011-2025  Custom symbols from any font can be inserted in any text by inserting a special 
sequence.
 
By
 
way
 
of
 
example,
 
the
 
'100%'
 
check
 
mark
 
is
 
represented
 
by
 
this
 
sequence:
  
 
  
\Webdings,1.4,97\
  
●
 
The
 
sequence
 
always
 
starts
 
and
 
ends
 
with
 
the
 
backslash
 
character
 
(\).
  
●
 
The
 
1st
 
parameter
 
is
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
any
 
font
 
installed
 
on
 
the
 
Windows
 
PC
 
that
 
PokerGFX

is
 
running
 
on
 
(note
 
this
 
is
 
independent
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
skin
 
font
 
embedded
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
file,
 
so
 
you
 
must
 
ensure
 
the
 
font
 
is
 
installed
 
on
 
the
 
PC
 
that
 
will
 
be

production

to
 
the

Webdings

is
 
the
 
numerical
 
code
 
for
 
the

  An easy way of figuring out the font and code is to use the 'Insert Symbol' function in

-
 
select
 
'More

select
 
the

2011-2025  Action Tracker 
By default, when used with the RFID table, the PokerGFX Server operates in Auto 
display
 
mode.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
all
 
active
 
players
 
are
 
displayed
 
from
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
a
 
hand,
 
and
 
are
 
removed
 
as
 
they
 
fold.
 
Board
 
cards
 
are
 
displayed
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
dealt,
 
along
 
with
 
each
 
player’s
 
pot
 
equity.
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
hand
 
the
 
display
 
is
 
cleared
 
ready
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
hand
 
to
 
begin.
 
All
 
of
 
this
 
happens
 
completely
 
automatically,
 
without
 
any
 
need
 
for
 
human
 
assistance.
 
In Auto mode, the server can’t display any betting or pot information as it has no way 
of
 
following
 
the
 
action.
 
To
 
create
 
the
 
complete
 
TV
 
style
 
viewing
 
experience,
 
it
 
needs
 
help
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
the
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
is
 
also
 
required
 
when
 
using
 
PokerGFX
 
without
 
an
 
RFID
 
table.
 
Action Tracker is a touch screen application that performs different functions 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
person
 
using
 
it:
 
Game Tracker Uses the main console of Action Tracker to enter chip counts and betting information as the game progresses, usually on a wireless touch tablet.  If you’re using PokerGFX in stand-alone mode, without an RFID table, Action Tracker is also used to enter hole and community cards.   Commentator / Director Uses the Statistics console to monitor chip counts and player statistics in real time. The commentator can also use the Statistics console to display chip counts over the live video at any time, and operate the scrolling ticker.    
/g0
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
has
 
a
 
User
 
Interface
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
heavily
 
optimized
 
for
 
fast
 
and
 
convenient
 
input
 
using
 
a
 
touch
 
screen
 
device.
 
While
 
it
 
is
 
possible
 
to
 
operate
 
it
 
with
 
a
 
mouse
 
this
 
is
 
NOT
 
recommended
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
far
 
slower.

2011-2025  Installing Action Tracker 
The Action Tracker software will run on any Windows 7, 8 or 10 device. The device 
you
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
user.
 
A
 
person
 
using
 
it
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
action
 
by
 
entering
 
bets,
 
calls
 
and
 
folds
 
might
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
wireless
 
tablet
 
for
 
portability.
 
A
 
commentator
 
is
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
run
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
desktop
 
PC
 
or
 
laptop
 
in
 
the
 
commentary
 
booth.
 
Action Tracker is multi-user and can run on multiple devices simultaneously for any 
single
 
table.
 
Commentary
 
mode
 
is
 
accessed
 
by
 
opening
 
separate
 
windows
 
from
 
the
 
main
 
application,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
arranged
 
on
 
single
 
or
 
multiple
 
displays
 
connected
 
to
 
one

or
 
across
 
multiple

if
 
required.
 
/g0
 
All
 
devices
 
running
 
Action

must
 
be
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network
 
as
 
the
 
computer
 
running
 
PokerGFX
 
Server.
 
Installing Action Tracker is extremely simple, as it is fully self contained in a single 
executable
 
program
 
file
 
(vpt_launcher.exe)
 
which
 
is
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
‘Remote’
 
sub-folder
 
of
 
the
 
main
 
installation
 
folder
 
specified
 
during
 
server
 
installation.
 
Simply
 
copy
 
the
 
file
 
to
 
the
 
target
 
computer
 
and
 
double
 
click
 
to

2011-2025  Run It Twice or Three times 
When no more betting can occur in a hand and all players still involved agree, the 
remaining
 
community
 
cards
 
can
 
be
 
dealt
 
more
 
than
 
once,
 
creating
 
multiple
 
separate
 
boards
 
from
 
that
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
hand.
 
The
 
pot
 
is
 
split
 
in
 
equal
 
proportions
 
between
 
the
 
winner(s)
 
of
 
each
 
board.
 
To
 
‘run
 
it
 
twice’,
 
touch
 
the
 
‘RUNNING
 
IT
 
X1’
 
button
 
any
 
time
 
before
 
the
 
first
 
river
 
card
 
is
 
dealt.
 
Boards
 
may
 
be
 
run
 
X1,
 
X2
 
or
 
X3.
 
When each board has been dealt and there’s another board still to come, the 
community
 
card
 
graphics
 
can
 
be
 
manually
 
cleared
 
in
 
preparation
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
board
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
NEXT
 
RUN
 
OUT
 
button.
 
If
 
this
 
button
 
isn’t
 
used
 
the
 
graphics
 
will
 
automatically
 
clear
 
when
 
the
 
first
 
card
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
board
 
is
 
dealt.
 
Double & Triple Boards 
When playing a hand with a double or triple board, touch the SINGLE / DOUBLE / 
TRIPLE
 
BOARD
 
button
 
on
 
the
 
hand
 
pre-start
 
screen
 
to
 
enable
 
this
 
feature.
 
The
 
dealer
 
should
 
first
 
deal
 
the
 
community
 
cards
 
to
 
the
 
normal
 
single
 
board
 
position
 
on
 
the
 
table,
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
second
 
board
 
above
 
these
 
cards,
 
and
 
the
 
third
 
board
 
(if
 
applicable)
 
below.
 
/g0
 
There’s
 
no
 
sensor
 
under
 
the
 
second
 
and
 
third
 
boards,
 
so
 
these
 
cards
 
must
 
be
 
entered
 
manually
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
by
 
touching
 
the
 
‘ENTER
 
CARDS’
 
button.
  
/g0
 
‘Run
 
It
 
Twice’
 
can’t
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
a
 
hand
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
double
 
or
 
triple
 
board.
  
Chops 
In a cash game, players might agree to ‘chop the pot’ at any time there’s no action 
pending.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
use
 
the
 
CHOP
 
button.
 
The
 
hand
 
will
 
end
 
immediately
 
with
 
the
 
pot
 
being
 
split
 
equally
 
between
 
players
 
still
 
in
 
the
 
hand.

2011-2025  Adjusting Chip Counts & Cumulative Winnings 
Chip counts can be adjusted either during a hand when action is on a player (for 
example
 
a
 
player
 
goes
 
all
 
in,
 
there’s
 
a
 
chip
 
count
 
and
 
it’s
 
different
 
to
 
the
 
stack
 
size
 
in
 
PokerGFX),
 
or
 
between
 
hands
 
(chip
 
count
 
updates
 
during
 
a
 
break,
 
or
 
when
 
a
 
new
 
player
 
enters
 
the
 
game.)
 
To adjust a player stack size, use the appropriate button with the chip icon. 
Adjusting chip counts in this way does NOT change the Cumulative Winnings player 
statistic.
 
Cumulative
 
Winnings
 
is
 
adjusted
 
automatically
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
hand,
 
however
 
sometimes
 
you
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
an
 
adjustment
 
manually.
 
The
 
most
 
common
 
reason
 
for
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
side
 
bet
 
or
 
game
 
feature
 
that
 
isn’t
 
directly
 
supported
 
by
 
PokerGFX.
 
For example, the 7-Deuce bounty is supported by PokerGFX and Cumulative Winnings 
are
 
automatically
 
updated
 
to
 
reflect
 
this
 
when
 
there’s
 
a
 
winner,
 
but
 
the
 
10-Deuce
 
bounty
 
isn’t
 
supported.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
use
 
the
 
TRANSFER
 
CHIPS
 
button.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
chip
 
button
 
next
 
to
 
the
 
START
 
HAND
 
button
 
in
 
the
 
hand
 
pre-start
 
screen
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
Using this feature allows you to quickly transfer chips between players while keeping 
Cumulative
 
Winnings
 
up
 
to
 
date.

2011-2025  MultiGFX 
The MultiGFX feature allows you to generate multiple video streams simultaneously 
from
 
a
 
single
 
RFID
 
table,
 
each
 
with
 
its
 
own
 
independent
 
graphics,
 
delay
 
and
 
video
 
settings.
 
 
This is achieved by running multiple copies of PokerGFX on separate computers which 
are
 
networked
 
together.
 
Enabling
 
the
 
‘MultiGFX’
 
option
 
forces
 
PokerGFX
 
to
 
use
 
another
 
running
 
copy
 
of
 
PokerGFX
 
as
 
a
 
data
 
source
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
physical
 
RFID
 
table.
 
To get started with a MultiGFX configuration, follow these steps: 
●
 
Connect
 
the
 
RFID
 
table
 
via
 
USB
 
and
 
start
 
PokerGFX
 
normally
 
(this
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX
 
that
 
controls
 
the
 
other
 
secondary
 
PokerGFXs).
  
●
 
Ensure
 
that
 
both
 
a
 
table
 
name
 
and
 
password
 
have
 
been
 
configured
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Start
 
PokerGFX
 
on
 
another
 
computer
 
(the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX)
 
that
 
is
 
networked
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Ensure
 
the
 
table
 
name
 
and
 
password
 
settings
 
in
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX
 
match
 
the
 
settings
 
configured
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX.
  
●
 
Enable
 
the
 
‘MultiGFX’
 
check
 
box
 
(on
 
the
 
secondary
 
server
 
only,
 
not
 
the
 
primary).
 
The
 
table
 
USB
 
icon
 
will
 
indicate
 
a
 
link
 
symbol.
 
The table USB icon should turn green, indicating the link is now active. Any game 
event
 
that
 
occurs
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
PokerGFX
 
will
 
be
 
transmitted
 
to
 
the
 
secondary
 
PokerGFX,
 
as
 
if
 
the
 
secondary
 
were
 
directly
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
RFID
 
table
 
itself.
 
You can now modify any settings in the secondary PokerGFX to customize the 
secondary
 
stream
 
as
 
required,
 
including
 
when
 
to
 
show
 
hole
 
cards,
 
graphics
 
‘skin’
 (Pro 
version
 
only), video resolution and stream delay (or none, if you want a live stream).

eliminated
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
a
 
catastrophic
 
failure
 
on
 
the

2011-2025  Studio  
**Pro Software License Required 
Introduction 
The Studio is a fully featured editing environment that allows you to fit the 
automatically
 
generated
 
graphics
 
to
 
the
 
edited
 
video
 
of
 
the
 
game.
 
This
 
is
 
necessary
 
because
 
the
 
final
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
is
 
different
 
to
 
the
 
raw
 
footage;
 
boring
 
hands
 
are
 
removed,
 
and
 
the
 
hands
 
that
 
are
 
included
 
are
 
usually
 
edited
 
so
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
the
 
original
 
game
 
is
 
changed
 
and
 
no
 
longer
 
matches
 
the
 
live
 
data.
 
●
 
As
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
played,
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
captures
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
live
 
data
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
table
 
and
 
saves
 
it
 
into
 
a
 
database;
  
●
 
The
 
final
 
video
 
edit
 
of
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
assembled
 
using
 
standard
 
3
rd
 
party
 
tools;
  
●
 
The
 
final
 
video
 
edit
 
is
 
loaded
 
into
 
the
 
Studio,
 
where
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
that
 
was
 
captured
 
during
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
manipulated
 
to
 
‘fit’
 
the
 
edited
 
video;
  
●
 
The
 
finished
 
hand
 
timeline
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
render
 
the
 
graphics
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
video.
 
During the editing process, some of the things you can do include: 
●
 
Changing
 
the
 
start
 
and
 
stop
 
time
 
of
 
a
 
hand,
 
and
 
the
 
times
 
at
 
which
 
each
 
individual
 
action
 
occurs
 
within
 
a
 
hand;
  
●
 
Fix
 
any
 
incorrect
 
betting
 
data
 
that
 
was
 
entered
 
into
 
the
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
during
 
the
 
game;
  
●
 
Remove
 
unwanted
 
hands;
  
●
 
Add
 
new
 
hands
 
that
 
weren’t
 
originally
 
recorded;
  
●
 
Work
 
with
 
multiple
 
videos
 
and
 
seamlessly
 
move
 
hands
 
between
 
them;

represent
 
hours,
 
minutes,
 
seconds
 
and
 
frame
 
number.
 
 
Video Library 
The Video Library is used to organise your video files. These are the edited game 
videos
 
to
 
which
 
you
 
will
 
fit
