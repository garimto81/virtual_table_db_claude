2011-2025  Installing Action Tracker 
The Action Tracker software will run on any Windows 7, 8 or 10 device. The device 
you
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
user.
 
A
 
person
 
using
 
it
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
action
 
by
 
entering
 
bets,
 
calls
 
and
 
folds
 
might
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
wireless
 
tablet
 
for
 
portability.
 
A
 
commentator
 
is
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
run
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
desktop
 
PC
 
or
 
laptop
 
in
 
the
 
commentary
 
booth.
 
Action Tracker is multi-user and can run on multiple devices simultaneously for any 
single
 
table.
 
Commentary
 
mode
 
is
 
accessed
 
by
 
opening
 
separate
 
windows
 
from
 
the
 
main
 
application,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
arranged
 
on
 
single
 
or
 
multiple
 
displays
 
connected
 
to
 
one
 
PC,
 
or
 
across
 
multiple
 
PCs
 
if
 
required.

All
 
devices
 
running
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
must
 
be
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network
 
as
 
the
 
computer
 
running
 
PokerGFX
 
Server.
 
Installing Action Tracker is extremely simple, as it is fully self contained in a single 
executable
 
program
 
file
 
(vpt_launcher.exe)
 
which
 
is
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
‘Remote’
 
sub-folder
 
of
 
the
 
main
 
installation
 
folder
 
specified
 
during
 
server
 
installation.
 
Simply
 
copy
 
the
 
file
 
to
 
the
 
target
 
computer
 
and
 
double
 
click
 
to
 
run
 
it.
 
Alternatively, install the full PokerGFX software suite and click the desktop Action 
Tracker
 
icon
 
to
 
start.

If
 
multiple
 
Servers
 
are
 
running
 
on
 
the
 
local
 
network,
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
available
 
servers
 
will
 
be
 
displayed
 
for
 
selection.
  
/g0
 
Action
 
tracker
 
contains
 
an
 
auto
 
update
 
feature.
 
Once
 
installed,
 
it
 
will
 
automatically
 
update
 
itself
 
to
 
the
 
latest
 
version
 
every
 
time
 
it
 
is
 
started.
  
●
 
If
 
the
 
selected
 
table
 
is
 
password
 
protected,
 
enter
 
the
 
password
 
to
 
continue.
