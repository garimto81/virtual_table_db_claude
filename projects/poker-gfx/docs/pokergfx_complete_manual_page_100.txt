Touch the camera button at the top of the display to open the Director console. The 
Director
 
console
 
shows
 
a
 
graphical
 
representation
 
of
 
the
 
action
 
at
 
the
 
table
 
and
 
allows
 
the
 
operator
 
to
 
manually
 
control
 
the
 
switching
 
of
 
video
 
sources
 
by
 
temporarily
 
overriding
 
the
 
auto
 
camera
 
switching
 
features.

control’
 
setting
 
in
 
the
 
Sources
 
settings
 
tab
 
in
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
is
 
disabled
 
when

This
 
ensures
 
the
 
camera
 
view
 
doesn’t
 
change
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
in-game
 
events
 
until
 
auto
 
camera
 
control
 
has
 
been
 
explicitly
 
re-enabled
 
by
 
the
 
operator.
 
Touching the OVL button at the top of the console toggles Overlay mode. Overlay 
mode
 
is

birds-eye
 
camera
 
vide
 
of
 
the
 
table.

of
 
the
