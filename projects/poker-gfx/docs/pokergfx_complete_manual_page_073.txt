2011-2025  Leaderboard Editor 
The Leaderboard editor works in the same way as the Player, Board and Blinds 
editors,
 
with
 
one
 
notable
 
difference.
 
The
 
Leaderboard
 
element
 
dynamically
 
resizes
 
itself
 
to
 
exactly
 
fit
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed.
 
The leaderboard element comprises 3 separate images; a header, a repeating section 
and
 
a
 
footer.
 
The
 
header
 
is
 
composited
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
leaderboard,
 
the
 
repeating
 
section
 
is
 
replicated
 
as
 
many
 
times
 
as
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
exactly
 
accommodate
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
players
 
to
 
be
 
displayed
 
below
 
that,
 
and
 
finally
 
the
 
footer
 
is
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
bottom.

3
 
separate
 
images
 
–
 
header,
 
repeating
 
section
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
repeating
 
section
 
must
 
be
 
sized
 
to
 
fit
 
a
 
single
 
line
 
or
 
player.

These
 
3
 
images
 
must
 
be
 
the
 
same
 
width.
  
●
 
Import
 
these
 
background
 
images
 
one
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
by
 
selecting
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
image
 
and
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Import’
 
button.

For
 
the
 
header
 
image
 
position
 
the
 
Title,
 
Game
 
Title
 
and
 
Player
 
Photo
 
elements.
 
For
 
the
 
repeating
 
image
 
position
 
the
 
Left,
 
Centre,
 
Flag
 
&
 
Right
 
columns,
 
and
 
finally
 
position
 
the
 
footer
 
text
 
on
 
the
 
footer
 
image.
  
A custom AnimIn sequence will only be enabled when AnimIn sequences are added 
to
 
all
 
3
 
images
 
(header,
 
repeat
 
&
 
footer).
 
It’s
 
not
 
possible
 
to
 
add
 
an
 
AnimIn
 
sequence
 
for
 
only
 
the
 
header
 
and
 
not
 
the
 
repeat
 
section
 
and
 
footer.
 
The
 
same
 
rule
 
applies
 
to
 
AnimOut
 
sequences,
 
but
 
not
 
the
 
Loop
 
animation.
