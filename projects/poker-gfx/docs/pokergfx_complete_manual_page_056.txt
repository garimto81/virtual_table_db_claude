2011-2025  PIP Remote Display 
A remote computer screen can be shown as a PIP (Picture-in-Picture) on the video 
output.
 
Use
 
this
 
feature
 
to
 
show
 
viewers
 
a
 
clone
 
of
 
your
 
tournament
 
clock
 
display
 
in
 
between
 
hands.
 
 
To enable this feature: 
●
 
Install
 
the
 
small
 
capture
 
program
 
on
 
the
 
remote
 
computer
 
by
 
copying
 
vpt_pipcap.exe
 
from
 
the
 
installation
 
folder.
 
Run
 
it
 
by
 
double-clicking.
 
This
 
program
 
captures
 
the
 
screen
 
output
 
and
 
sends
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
Server.
  
/g0
 
The
 
remote
 
computer
 
must
 
be
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
Local
 
Area
 
Network
 
as
 
the
 
Server.
  
●
 
Start
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
and
 
enable
 
the
 
checkbox
 
next
 
to
 
the
 
PIP
 
button.
  
/g0
 
The
 
PIP
 
will
 
be
 
displayed
 
automatically
 
every
 
time
 
a
 
hand
 
ends,
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
hidden
 
when
 
a
 
new
 
hand
 
starts.
 
If
 
the
 
Auto
 
Stats
 
feature
 
is
 
enabled,
 
the
 
PIP
 
will
 
be
 
shown
 
after
 
the
 
Leaderboard
 
is
 
hidden.
 
To customize the appearance of the PIP: 
●
 
Click
 
the
 
'Configure'
 
button
 
in
 
the
 
Graphics
 
settings.
 
At
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
PIP
 
Editor,
 
an
 
image
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
output
 
is
 
displayed.
 
At
 
the
 
bottom
 
is
 
a
 
clone
 
of
 
the
 
display
 
on
 
the
 
remote
 
computer.
  
●
 
Select
 
the
 
capture
 
area
 
on
 
the
 
remote
 
computer
 
(by
 
default
 
the
 
full
 
screen
 
is
 
selected).
 
A
 
yellow
 
rectangle
 
shows
 
the
 
capture
 
area.
 
Click
 
the
 
left
 
mouse
 
button
 
to
 
set
 
the
 
top
 
left
 
corner,
 
then
 
the
 
right
 
button
 
to
 
set
 
the
 
bottom
 
right
 
corner.
 
Both
 
corners
 
can
 
be
 
‘dragged’
 
by
 
moving
 
the
 
mouse
 
while
 
a
 
button
 
is
 
held
 
down.
  
●
 
Select
 
the
 
area
 
on
 
the
 
video
 
output
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
image
 
where
 
you
 
would
 
like
 
the
 
the
 
display
 
(PIP)
 
to
 
appear.
 
The
 
PIP
 
area
 
is
 
shown
 
with
 
a
 
red
 
rectangle.
 
Use
 
the
 
same
 
mouse
 
buttons
 
to
 
select
 
the
 
PIP
 
area.
  
/g0
 
Only
 
the
 
height
 
of
 
the
 
PIP
 
can
 
be
 
changed.
 
The
 
width
 
is
 
automatically
 
selected
 
to
 
maintain
 
the
 
same
 
aspect
 
ratio
 
as
 
the
 
capture
 
area
 
on
 
the
 
remote
 
computer.
 
This
 
ensures
 
the
 
image
 
does
 
not
 
look
 
‘stretched’.
