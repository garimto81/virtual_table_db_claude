2011-2025  Cards 
A skin can contain multiple card sets. A card set consists of 52 fronts or faces, a card 
back
 
and
 
a
 
special
 
‘rabbit’
 
overlay.

The
 
rabbit
 
overlay
 
should
 
be
 
an
 
image
 
the
 
same
 
size
 
as
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
card
 
images,
 
with
 
a
 
mainly
 
transparent
 
or
 
semi-transparent
 
background
 
and
 
a
 
bold
 
‘X’
 
or
 
similar
 
symbol
 
to
 
indicate
 
a
 
card
 
is
 
not
 
valid.
 
It
 
is
 
composited
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
another
 
card
 
under
 
certain
 
circumstances.
 
Skins commonly contain 1 or 2 card sets (however there’s no limit to the number of 
sets).
 
Where
 
there
 
are
 
2
 
card
 
sets,
 
typically
 
one
 
will
 
contain
 
black
 
and
 
red
 
cards
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
will
 
contain
 
four
 
colour
 
cards.
 
Create a card set by placing 53 PNG images in an empty folder, named according to 
the
 
below
 
table.
 
To import the cards, add a new card set by clicking the ‘Add’ button. Replace the 
currently
 
selected
 
card
 
set
 
by
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Replace’
 
button.

You
 
can
 
specify
 
a
 
different
 
card
 
set
 
for
 
individual
 
game
 
variants
 
by
 
enabling
 
the
 
‘Override
 
Card
 
Set’
 
checkbox.
