2011-2025  Card Backs 
Card backs are displayed briefly when a known card animates on to the display, or 
when
 
a
 
card
 
is

The
 
default
 
back
 
can
 
be
 
replaced
 
with
 
a
 
custom
 
logo.
 
Click
 
the
 
‘Card

file.
 
Flags Importer 
The Country Flags feature displays the flag of each players country in the player and 
leaderboard
 
graphic
 
elements,
 
once
 
a
 
country
 
has
 
been
 
selected
 
for
 
the
 
player
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker.
 
 
The default skin contains up to date flags for every country. Use this feature to 
customize
 
the
 
flag
 
images.
 
●
 
In
 
an
 
empty
 
folder,
 
place
 
PNG
 
image
 
files
 
that
 
contain
 
the
 
flags
 
of
 
the
 
countries
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
available
 
for
 
selection.
 
The
 
name
 
of
 
each
 
file
 
is
 
the
 
country
 
name
 
that
 
will
 
appear
 
in
 
Action

(eg.
 
Australia.png
 
is
 
an

flag).

Click
 
the

The
 
Flags
 
feature
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
any
 
affiliation
 
(you
 
might
 
use
 
team
 
names
 
and
 
logos
 
instead
 
of
 
country
 
flags).
  
/g0
 
When
 
a
 
country
 
is
 
assigned
 
to
 
a
 
player
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker,
 
the
 
‘with
 
photo’
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
player
 
graphic
 
element
 
is
 
always
 
enabled
 
(as
 
if
 
a
 
photo
 
was
 
active
 
for
 
that
 
player).
 
Split Screen Divider 
This is the graphic that is displayed in the centre of the screen when Heads Up Split 
Screen
 
mode
 
is
 
active.
 
Normally
 
this
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
thin
 
vertical
 
line
 
to
 
separate
 
the
 
left
 
and
 
right
 
camera
 
views,
 
but
 
can
 
be
 
any
 
screen
 
overlay.
 
Custom
 
animations
 
are
 
supported
 
by
 
selecting
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
PNG
 
files.
