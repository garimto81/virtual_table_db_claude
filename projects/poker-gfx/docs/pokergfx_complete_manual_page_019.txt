USB cable connected The RFID Reader will use the USB connection to communicate with the Server. If the USB cable is removed, the RFID Reader will automatically switch to WIFI to ensure the game is not interrupted and no data is lost. When the USB connection is restored, the RFID Reader automatically switches back to USB mode.   No USB cable WIFI mode only. The RFID Reader will communicate with the Server wirelessly.
