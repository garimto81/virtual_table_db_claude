2011-2025  Secure Delay 
This feature causes a security delay to be introduced to the live video stream. For 
example,
 
to
 
delay
 
the
 
stream
 
by
 
20
 
minutes,
 
enter
 
the
 
value
 
‘20’.
 
Start
 
the
 
delay
 
by
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Secure
 
Delay’
 
checkbox.
 
As the live stream is stored for playback, a clock below the ‘Secure Delay’ checkbox 
setting
 
shows
 
the
 
length
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
shifted
 
video.
 
When Secure Delay is active: 
●
 
The
 
padlock
 
indicator
 
will
 
lock
 
and
 
turn
 
green
 
to
 
indicate
 
hole
 
cards
 
are
 
secure.
  
●
 
The
 
live
 
preview
 
window
 
shows
 
hole
 
cards
 
DOWN,
 
but
 
the
 
delayed
 
output
 
shows
 
hole
 
cards
 
UP.
  
●
 
The
 
live
 
preview
 
is
 
safe
 
for
 
real
 
time
 
display
 
at
 
the
 
venue,
 
showing
 
all
 
action
 
except
 
hole
 
cards,
 
equities,
 
outs
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
information
 
that
 
might
 
indicate
 
what
 
the
 
hole
 
cards
 
are.
  
●
 
(Optional)
 
In
 
the
 
live
 
preview,
 
hole
 
cards
 
blink
 
until
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
scanned.
 
Blinking
 
cards
 
have
 
either
 
not
 
been
 
placed
 
on
 
the
 
antenna
 
by
 
the
 
player,
 
or
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
of
 
the
 
cards
 
is
 
dead
 
and
 
needs
 
replacement.
  
●
 
Hole
 
cards
 
may
 
be
 
scanned
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
before
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
hand
 
without
 
affecting
 
the
 
GFX
 
display.
 
This
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
offer
 
players
 
the
 
additional
 
security
 
of
 
not
 
scanning
 
their
 
cards
 
until
 
folding
 
or
 
at
 
showdown,
 
and
 
provides
 
the
 
additional
 
benefit
 
that
 
hole
 
cards
 
are
 
displayed
 
from
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
hand
 
even
 
though
 
they
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
scanned
 
until
 
later.
  
●
 
Player
 
photos
 
can
 
be
 
added
 
any
 
time
 
before
 
a
 
hand
 
is
 
replayed
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
delay.
 
They
 
will
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
previous
 
hands
 
retrospectively.
  
●

the
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
UNDO
 
key
 
show
 
in
 
the
 
live
 
preview,
 
but
 
are
 
automatically
 
tidied
 
up
 
before
 
the
 
delayed
 
output,
 
so
 
you
 
don’t
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
HIDE
 
GFX
 
button.
