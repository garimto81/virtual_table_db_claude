Many graphic elements support custom animation from a sequence of user supplied

images.
 
Custom
 
animations
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
achieve
 
effects
 
like
 
player
 
graphics
 
‘unfolding’
 
onto
 
the
 
screen,
 
and
 
then
 
animating
 
a
 
moving
 
bar
 
while
 
waiting
 
for
 
a
 
player
 
to
 
act.
 
Where
 
supported,
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
separate
 
animations
 
can
 
be
 
configured
 
for
 
each

and
 
optional
 
bounce
 
effects
 
that
 
are
 normally applied after the ‘Trans In’ animation has completed are disabled when a custom AnimIn animation is enabled.
