2011-2025  Camera Transitions 
When the ‘Crossfade’ setting is zero, camera sources transition with a hard cut. 
Setting
 
this
 
value
 
to
 
a
 
higher
 
value
 
between
 
0.1
 
and
 
2.0
 
causes
 
sources
 
to
 
crossfade,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
softer,
 
more
 
fluid
 
transition.
 
The
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
setting
 
is
 
time
 
taken
 
for
 
a
 
crossfade
 
to
 
complete,
 
in
 
seconds
 
(ie.
 
higher
 
value
 
is
 
slower).
 
Board Sync 
Delays the detection of community cards by the specified number of milliseconds. 
This
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
compensate
 
for
 
the
 
problem
 
where
 
community
 
card
 
graphics
 
are
 
displayed
 
before
 
the
 
cards
 
are
 
shown
 
being
 
dealt
 
on
 
video.
 
This
 
phenomenon
 
is
 
caused
 
in
 
some
 
environments
 
with
 
high
 
video
 
latency
 
introduced
 
by
 
external
 
switching
 
and
 
conversion
 
equipment.
 
Using an External Switcher 
When using a camera source for video capture from an external vision switcher, 
select
 
this
 
capture
 
device
 
using
 
the
 
'External
 
Switcher
 
Source'
 
dropdown
 
box.
 
This
 
disables
 
the
 
built-in
 
multi-camera
 
switching
 
features
 
(except
 
when
 
using
 
ATEM
 
control,
 
where
 
an
 
external
 
video
 
switcher
 
can
 
be
 
controlled
 
by
 
PokerGFX).
 
Audio Input 
Select the desired audio capture device and volume. The Sync setting adjusts the 
timing
 
of
 
the
 
audio
 
signal
 
to
 
match
 
the
 
video,
 
if
 
required.
