2011-2025  Action Clock 
Action Clock is an app that can be downloaded separately and run on a low cost 
Windows
 
tablet.
 
It
 
is
 
a
 
lightweight
 
yet
 
fully
 
featured
 
player
 
shot
 
clock
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
controlled
 
directly
 
by
 
the
 
dealer.
 
Extremely
 
simple
 
to
 
use
 
with
 
large
 
buttons
 
and
 
a
 
clock
 
display
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
oriented
 
either
 
towards
 
the
 
dealer
 
or
 
towards
 
the
 
players,
 
it
 
only
 
has
 
4
 
functions
 
–
 
Start/Reset
 
Clock,
 
Pause
 
Clock,
 
Stop
 
Clock
 
and
 
Add
 
Time.
 
Action Clock can either be used continuously in turbo games where each player has a 
maximum
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
to
 
act,
 
or
 
on
 
an
 
as
 
needed
 
basis
 
when
 
someone
 
‘calls
 
the
 
clock’
 
on
 
another
 
player.
 
It
 
is
 
fully
 
configurable,
 
with
 
optional
 
warning
 
sounds.
 
Action Clock does not require a PokerGFX Server to operate, however when a server 
is
 
detected
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
local
 
network,
 
the
 
clock
 
status
 
is
 
automatically
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
Server.
 
 
NOTE: This feature is only available with a Pro server license. 
In this mode, PokerGFX will automatically display the number of seconds players have 
left
 
to
 
act
 
whenever
 
the
 
timer
 
reaches
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
seconds
 
specified
 
in
 
the
 
Graphics
 
Settings
 
->
 
Action
 
Clock
 
setting.
 
The
 
timer
 
is
 
also
 
displayed
 
if
 
the
 
Action
 
Clock
 
‘Add
 
Time’
 
button
 
is
 
used.
 
Action Clock can be downloaded from the videopokertable.net website.
