2011-2025  Colour Adjustment 
Clicking the ‘Adjust Colours’ button displays a dialog box that enables adjustment of 
the
 
red,
 
green
 
and
 
blue
 
levels
 
for
 
every
 
graphic
 
element
 
in
 
the
 
skin
 
with
 
a
 
single
 
click.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
handy
 
way
 
of
 
quickly
 
re-colouring
 
a
 
skin
 
to
 
match
 
a
 
specific
 
colour
 
palette
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
modify
 
the
 
actual
 
images
 
contained
 
in
 
the
 
skin.
 
Circular Player Photos 
If the ‘Crop player photo to circle’ checkbox is enabled, all player photos will 
automatically
 
be
 
cropped
 
to
 
a
 
circle
 
that
 
fits
 
wholly
 
inside
 
the
 
bounds
 
of
 
the
 
player
 
photo
 
position
 
in
 
the
 
player
 
graphic.
