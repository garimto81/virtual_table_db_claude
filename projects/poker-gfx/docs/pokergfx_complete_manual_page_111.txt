2011-2025  Rendering the Video 
The final stage is to produce the finished video by rendering the graphics. Ensure the 
correct
 
video
 
to
 
render
 
is
 
selected
 
from
 
the
 
Video
 
Library
 
and
 
click
 
the
 
‘Render’
 
button.
 
/g0
 
The
 
video
 
will
 
be
 
rendered
 
using
 
the
 
current
 
settings
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
PokerGFX
 
window.
  
●
 
To
 
render
 
the
 
graphics
 
over
 
a
 
green
 
screen
 
background
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
video,
 
check
 
the
 
‘Chroma
 
Key’
 
option.
  
/g0
 
The
 
background
 
colour
 
can
 
be
 
selected
 
by
 
clicking
 
the
 
‘Background
 
Key
 
Colour’
 
button
 
in
 
the
 
Sources
 
Settings
 
window.
  
●
 
To
 
render
 
only
 
hands
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
checked
 
in
 
the
 
Playlist,
 
check
 
the
 
‘Selected
 
Only’
 
option
 
(un-checking
 
this
 
option
 
will
 
cause
 
all
 
hands,
 
including
 
those
 
unchecked,
 
to
 
be
 
rendered).
  
●
 
If
 
the
 
‘Entire
 
Video’
 
box
 
is
 
checked,
 
the
 
rendered
 
output
 
will
 
contain
 
the
 
entire
 
source
 
video
 
from
 
start
 
to
 
finish.
 
If
 
unchecked,
 
the
 
rendered
 
output
 
video
 
will
 
start
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
as
 
the
 
first
 
rendered
 
hand,
 
and
 
finish
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
last
 
rendered
 
hand.
 
This
 
option
 
is
 
useful
 
if
 
you
 
only
 
want
 
to
 
render
 
a
 
small
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
that
 
contains
 
only
 
a
 
few
 
hands.
  
●

from
 
the
 
source
 
video
 
can
 
be
 
muted
 
from
 
the
 
output
 
video
 
by
 
enabling
 
the
 
‘Mute’
 
option.

The
 
rendering
 
process
 
can
 
be
 
stopped
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
by
 
clicking
 
the

button.

The
 
Studio
 
window
 
cannot
 
be
 
closed
 
while
 
rendering
 
is
 
in
 
progress.

During
 
rendering,
 
a
 
preview
 
of
 
the
 
final
 
output
 
is
 
displayed
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
Preview
 
window.
