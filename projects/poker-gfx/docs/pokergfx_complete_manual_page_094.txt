2011-2025  Run It Twice or Three times 
When no more betting can occur in a hand and all players still involved agree, the 
remaining
 
community
 
cards
 
can
 
be
 
dealt
 
more
 
than
 
once,
 
creating
 
multiple
 
separate
 
boards
 
from
 
that
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
hand.
 
The
 
pot
 
is
 
split
 
in
 
equal
 
proportions
 
between
 
the
 
winner(s)
 
of
 
each
 
board.
 
To
 
‘run
 
it
 
twice’,
 
touch
 
the
 
‘RUNNING
 
IT
 
X1’
 
button
 
any
 
time
 
before
 
the
 
first
 
river
 
card
 
is
 
dealt.
 
Boards
 
may
 
be
 
run
 
X1,
 
X2
 
or
 
X3.
 
When each board has been dealt and there’s another board still to come, the 
community
 
card
 
graphics
 
can
 
be
 
manually
 
cleared
 
in
 
preparation
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
board
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
NEXT
 
RUN
 
OUT
 
button.
 
If
 
this
 
button
 
isn’t
 
used
 
the
 
graphics
 
will
 
automatically
 
clear
 
when
 
the
 
first
 
card
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
board
 
is
 
dealt.
 
Double & Triple Boards 
When playing a hand with a double or triple board, touch the SINGLE / DOUBLE / 
TRIPLE
 
BOARD
 
button
 
on
 
the
 
hand
 
pre-start
 
screen
 
to
 
enable
 
this
 
feature.
 
The
 
dealer
 
should
 
first
 
deal
 
the
 
community
 
cards
 
to
 
the
 
normal
 
single
 
board
 
position
 
on
 
the
 
table,
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
second
 
board
 
above
 
these
 
cards,
 
and
 
the
 
third
 
board
 
(if
 
applicable)
 
below.
 
/g0
 
There’s
 
no
 
sensor
 
under
 
the
 
second
 
and
 
third
 
boards,
 
so
 
these
 
cards
 
must
 
be
 
entered
 
manually
 
in
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
by
 
touching
 
the
 
‘ENTER
 
CARDS’
 
button.
  
/g0
 
‘Run
 
It
 
Twice’
 
can’t
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
a
 
hand
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
double
 
or
 
triple
 
board.
  
Chops 
In a cash game, players might agree to ‘chop the pot’ at any time there’s no action 
pending.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
use
 
the
 
CHOP
 
button.
 
The
 
hand
 
will
 
end
 
immediately
 
with
 
the
 
pot
 
being
 
split
 
equally
 
between
 
players
 
still
 
in
 
the
 
hand.
