Introduction 
The Studio is a fully featured editing environment that allows you to fit the 
automatically
 
generated
 
graphics
 
to
 
the
 
edited
 
video
 
of
 
the
 
game.
 
This
 
is
 
necessary
 
because
 
the
 
final
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
video
 
is
 
different
 
to
 
the
 
raw
 
footage;
 
boring
 
hands
 
are
 
removed,
 
and
 
the
 
hands
 
that
 
are
 
included
 
are
 
usually
 
edited
 
so
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
the
 
original
 
game
 
is
 
changed
 
and
 
no
 
longer
 
matches
 
the
 
live
 
data.
 
●
 
As
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
played,
 
the
 
PokerGFX
 
Server
 
captures
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
live
 
data
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
table
 
and
 
saves
 
it
 
into
 
a
 
database;
  
●
 
The
 
final
 
video
 
edit
 
of
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
assembled
 
using
 
standard
 
3
rd
 
party
 
tools;
  
●
 
The
 
final
 
video
 
edit
 
is
 
loaded
 
into
 
the
 
Studio,
 
where
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
that
 
was
 
captured
 
during
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
manipulated
 
to
 
‘fit’
 
the
 
edited
 
video;
  
●
 
The
 
finished
 
hand
 
timeline
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
render
 
the
 
graphics
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
video.
 
During the editing process, some of the things you can do include: 
●
 
Changing
 
the
 
start
 
and
 
stop
 
time
 
of
 
a
 
hand,
 
and
 
the
 
times
 
at
 
which
 
each
 
individual
 
action
 
occurs
 
within
 
a
 
hand;
  
●
 
Fix
 
any
 
incorrect
 
betting
 
data
 
that
 
was
 
entered
 
into
 
the
 
Action
 
Tracker
 
during
 
the
 
game;
  
●
 
Remove
 
unwanted
 
hands;
  
●
 
Add
 
new
 
hands
 
that
 
weren’t
 
originally
 
recorded;
  
●
 
Work
 
with
 
multiple
 
videos
 
and
 
seamlessly
 
move
 
hands
 
between
 
them;
