2011-2025  Ignore Name Tags When enabled, player ID tags are ignored; player names are entered manually in Action Tracker.   UPCARD antennas read hole cards draw & flop games Enables all antennas configured for reading UPCARDS in STUD games to also detect hole cards when playing any flop or draw game, expanding the size of the effective card reading area for each player to include both the regular hole card antenna as well as the UPCARD antenna. When this feature is disabled these antennas are only active during STUD games. 
  Disable Muck Causes the muck antenna to be disabled when in Action Tracker mode. This can make following the action more intuitive when in certain card reveal modes.   Secure Delay Folder By default the files that are generated when the Secure Delay feature is active are stored in the current user’s Windows temporary files folder. These files occupy approximately 50 GB of space for a video size of 1920 x 1080, which can cause a problem if the Windows drive is small or low on space. Click the ‘Secure Delay Folder’ button to specify a storage folder on a different drive.
