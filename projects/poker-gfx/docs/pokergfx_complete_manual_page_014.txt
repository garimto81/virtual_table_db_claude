2011-2025  Video sources may be any combination of USB webcams, HD/UHD video capture 
devices
 
and
 
network
 
cameras.
 
Most
 
Windows
 
DirectShow-compatible
 
devices
 
are
 
supported.
 
USB Webcams 
Most USB webcams consume too much bandwidth on the USB controller for more 
than
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
to
 
work
 
reliably,
 
and
 
are
 
not
 
recommended.
 
For multiple webcams, the Logitech C920 is the only model that has been tested 
and
 
is
 
officially
 
supported.
 
This
 
webcam
 
offers
 
decent
 
picture
 
quality,
 
the
 
widest
 
viewing
 
angle,
 
and
 
MJPEG
 
compression
 
technology
 
that
 
reduces
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
USB
 
bandwidth
 
required.

For
 
maximum
 
reliability,
 
it
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
install
 
multiple
 
USB
 
controller
 
cards
 
in
 
the
 
server
 
PC,
 
and
 
connect
 
no
 
more
 
than
 
2
 
webcams
 
to
 
each.
 
Capture Devices 
Any video capture device that is compliant with Windows DirectShow WDM may be 
used,
 
however
 
there
 
is
 
optimized
 
support
 
for
 
Blackmagic
 
Decklink
 
cards,
 
and
 
these
 
are
 
recommended
 
for
 
best
 
reliability
 
and
 
picture
 
quality.
 
/g0
 
A
 
Blackmagic
 
Decklink
 
Duo
 
2
 
card
 
will
 
provide
 
4
 
full
 
HD
 
inputs
 
at
 
1080p60,
 
and
 
is
 
the
 
recommended
 
capture
 
device
 
for
 
broadcast
 
quality
 
systems.
 
Network cameras 
Remote network cameras that support RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols are 
supported
 
and
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
any
 
other
 
capture
 
device.
