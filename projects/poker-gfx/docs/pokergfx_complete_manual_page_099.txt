Delayed Commentary Stats & GFX 
NOTE: This option is only available with a Pro license. 
When the secure delay feature is active, touch the ‘LIVE’ button to toggle between 
Live
 
and
 
Delayed
 
stats.
 
This
 
enables
 
commentators
 
to
 
commentate
 
on
 
a
 
delayed
 
stream
 
while
 
seeing
 
matching
 
player
 
statistics
 
that
 
are
 
synced
 
with
 
the
 
delay.
 
For example, if the secure delay is 30 minutes, commentators see 'live' stats from 30 
minutes
 
ago.
 
In
 
this
 
mode,
 
when
 
a
 
button
 
is
 
touched
 
to
 
superimpose
 
a
 
leaderboard
 
over
 
the
 
video,
 
the
 
graphic
 
appears
 
live
 
(with
 
stats
 
that
 
are
 
30
 
minutes
 
old),
 
not
 
delayed
 
by
 
30
 
minutes.
